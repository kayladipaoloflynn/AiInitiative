      "question": "What are the underlying risks associated with performing our work on this project?",
      "answer": "DIRECT ANSWER: The main underlying risks associated with performing the work on this project are working at heights, using combustible products, and coordinating with multiple trades on site.\n\nEVIDENCE:\nKEL-WoodLake-BR(10)(VC): \"So definitely Kevin and Cory, there will be a situation with multiple trades in our way. We'll have to coordinate leverage and making sure we've got the safety zone set up around all lifting equipment as soon as the perimeter of our work.\"\nMultiple speakers: \"And to add that, I you're working on wood deck lot of torch, so safety to be watched out for.\"\n\nADDITIONAL CONTEXT:\n- They will need to remove all combustibles from the working area to a safe distance when torch applying the roof. \n- Guardrails will need to be set up around the perimeter for fall protection when working at heights.\n- The site conditions will need to be reviewed closer to the start date to assess risks.\n\nMISSING INFO:\n- The specific site logistics and layout are not discussed in detail, which could impact the level of risk and coordination required.\n- Any unique safety requirements or protocols required by the general contractor are not covered."

      "question": "Do we need to bring any alternates to the attention of the client/customer before starting?",
      "answer": "DIRECT ANSWER: Yes, roof anchors were shown as a bidding item and need to be confirmed with the client before starting.\n\nEVIDENCE:\nFrank Jonathan: \"Apart from that, I don't see any other items to be confirmed as everything was bid per letter.\"\nKEL-WoodLake-BR(10)(VC): \"So, items to be confirmed would be roof anchors were shown as a bidding.\"\n\nADDITIONAL CONTEXT: The discussion indicates that roof anchors were included in the bid as an alternate, but need to be explicitly confirmed with the client before beginning work. No other major alternates were identified that require client confirmation prior to starting.\n\nMISSING INFO: The transcript does not provide details on the specific roof anchor product or quantity that was included as an alternate in the bid. More information on the roof anchor specs and pricing may be needed."

KEL-WoodLake-BR(10)(VC): \"We don't have the \u2013 I don't believe we have the prompt payment rules yet, but it, will take for the invoice to be paid and then the payment terms.\"\n3. Frank Jonathan: \"No, we don't bonding. No bonding.\"\n\nADDITIONAL CONTEXT: The team does not yet have a copy of the prime contract to review all the terms. They are also unsure about the prompt payment rules and invoice payment terms at this stage. Additionally, there is no bonding or performance bond required for this project.\n\nMISSING INFO: The exact payment terms, invoicing requirements, and other contractual obligations are not fully known since the prime contract has not been reviewed yet. Having a copy of this would help identify any other potential risks."

      "question": "What are the underlying risks associated with performing our work on this project?",
      "answer": "Based on the discussion, there are a few key risks identified with performing the roofing work on this project:\n\n1. Multiple trades working in the same areas, requiring coordination and safety zones around lifting equipment and work perimeters. As Kevin stated: \"there will be a situation with multiple trades in our way. We'll have to coordinate leverage and making sure we've got the safety zone set up around all lifting equipment as soon as the perimeter of our work.\"\n\n2. Working on a wood deck with a lot of torch-applied materials poses a fire safety risk. As Frank noted: \"you're working on wood deck lot of torch, so safety to be watched out for.\"\n\n3. Working at heights requires proper fall protection setup. Dariusz mentioned: \"Working at the heights, we'll have our guardrail set up around the perimeter.\"\n\n4. Cold weather application may be required as the project extends into late fall/winter. Dariusz stated: \"So we'll definitely have some limitations with the With the cap stripping installation, like the cut-off is zero degree, I'll have to make sure that the customer aware of that. We'll have to use a winter rated product, so winter rated primers for the SOPRA VAP.\"\n\nThe key seems to be proactively coordinating with other trades, strictly following torch safety protocols on the wood deck, ensuring proper fall protection is in place, and planning for cold weather installation as needed. Clear communication of these risks and mitigation plans to the client will be important."

      "question": "Do we need to bring any alternates to the attention of the client/customer before starting?",
      "answer": "Based on the discussion, a few items were identified that need to be confirmed or brought to the attention of the client before starting:\n\n1. Roof anchors - Frank Jonathan stated: \"Apart from that, I don't see any other alternates to be confirmed as everything was as per spec letter.\"\n\n2. Membrane base sheet - KEL-WoodLake-BR(10)(VC) suggested using SOPRA-INFLAM 180 base sheet instead of the 250 FR cap sheet on the concrete deck as a potential cost savings, since it will be covered by drainage mat and insulation. This needs to be confirmed with the client.\n\n3. Pre-stripping - KEL-WoodLake-BR(10)(VC) stated: \"Also any kind of pre-stripping we'll have to do on the time material base which will be probably safer for us. It will be difficult with that amount of the planters on site.\"\n\n4. Wind uplift calculations - The team used generic wind uplift calculator values in the estimate, but needs to confirm the actual requirements with the client. KEL-WoodLake-BR(10)(VC) noted: \"sometimes they have a little bit stricter requirements than what's needed.\"\n\nSo in summary, roof anchors, base sheet membrane change, pre-stripping, and confirming wind uplift requirements should be discussed with the client before proceeding. The team flagged these to ensure alignment and approval from the client."

      "answer": "According to the discussion, the roofing scope is scheduled as follows:\n\nFrank Jonathan stated: \"The start roofing is scheduled for 13th of October 2025. And the project is scheduled for 128 crew with total crew.\"\n\nSo the key details are:\n- Roofing start date: October 13, 2025\n- Total crew days scheduled: 128\n\nAn expected completion date was not explicitly mentioned, but can be estimated based on the 128 crew days scheduled from the October 13, 2025 start date."

      "question": "What are the payment terms?",
      "answer": "Based on the discussion, it seems the payment terms are not yet known. A few key points:\n\n- KEL-WoodLake-BR(10)(VC) asked \"What are the payment terms and how long it will take for our invoice to be paid?\" \n\n- KEL-WoodLake-BR(10)(VC) stated: \"We don't have the \u2013 I don't believe we have the prompt payment rules yet, but it, will take for the invoice to be paid and then the payment terms.\"\n\n- They do not have a copy of the prime contract yet to determine if prompt payment rules apply. KEL-WoodLake-BR(10)(VC) said \"That will be requested.\"\n\nSo in summary, the payment terms are still to be determined. The construction team plans to request a copy of the prime contract which should provide more details on the applicable payment terms and timeline for this project. This is an open item that needs follow-up."

Some scope items like roof anchors still need to be confirmed with the client. Frank noted \"roofing anchors to be confirmed.\"\n\n5. The wind uplift calculations were done internally using a calculator tool, but need to be confirmed with the client's requirements. KEL-WoodLake-BR(10)(VC) stated: \"We obtained that from the wind uplift calculator. Okay, so we'll have to confirm with the client.\"\n\nThe team should follow up on getting the prime contract, confirming scope and wind uplift requirements with the client, and clarifying payment terms and prompt payment rules that apply. Lack of bonding is also a risk to be aware of."
