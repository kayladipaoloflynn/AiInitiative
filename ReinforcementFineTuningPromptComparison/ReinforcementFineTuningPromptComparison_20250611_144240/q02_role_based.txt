1. Direct quotes from the transcript  
   • KEL-WoodLake (24:13–24:25):  
     “So who is the customer for the project, describe our past working with any—are there any concerns to note before proceeding?”  
   • Frank Jonathan (24:25–24:34):  
     “Me personally, I’ve never worked with the construction so I can’t comment on the relationship… I don’t know… haven’t worked either. It’s our first project with them.”  
   • KEL-WoodLake (24:49–24:55):  
     “We’ve got Brian Rich who is the project manager for Grayback. We’ve got Earl Faraguna who is the construction manager and Bob McAllister who is the superintendent. So this is the main contact list for us.”  

2. Expert interpretation  
   – There are no indicated performance or relationship issues with the customer; the team explicitly states they have no prior experience with Grayback.  
   – Because this is the first engagement, there is inherent “new-vendor” risk: unknown payment history, contract administration practices, and site coordination.  
   – The team has identified the key Grayback contacts (project manager, construction manager, superintendent), which is a good first step toward clarifying communication channels.  

3. Professional summary  
   At this point, the transcript does not reveal any specific concerns or past performance issues with Grayback: it is simply a first-time relationship. Before proceeding, the project team should:  
   • Confirm Grayback’s prompt-payment and invoice requirements (including any provincial prompt payment legislation).  
   • Secure or review the prime contract to clarify payment terms, bonding requirements and ancillary obligations.  
   • Verify the creditworthiness or payment track record of Grayback and, if needed, consider securing progress payment bonds or retainage provisions.  
   • Maintain close coordination with the identified Grayback contacts (Brian Rich, Earl Faraguna and Bob McAllister) to ensure clarity on scheduling, site access, crane usage, and safety protocols.  
   Taking these due-diligence steps will mitigate the “first-time customer” risk and establish a disciplined contract-management framework for the handover.
