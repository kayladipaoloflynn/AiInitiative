1. Direct quotes from the transcript  
   a) KEL-WoodLake –BR(10)(VC) (31:18–31:22):  
      “The estimating provides construction team a complete global takeoff.”  
      Frank Jonathan (31:23): “Yes, it’s there on your folder.”  
   b) Frank Jonathan (17:28–17:33):  
      “So color-coded in phase 1 A and B for WP08 and P10. Then you have your conventional assemblies listed down … and then, yeah, quite an extensive number coded to what’s there on the drawings.”

2. Expert interpretation  
   • When KEL asks whether the estimating group has delivered “a complete global takeoff,” Frank’s confirmation that “it’s there on your folder” indicates that the package has already been uploaded to the shared project directory.  
   • Frank’s earlier description of “color-coded” drawings for WP08 and WP10 confirms that those digital mark-ups (most likely prepared in Bluebeam) highlight exactly which roof areas and assemblies fall within our scope.  
   • Together, those exchanges show that the estimating team did supply a fully detailed take-off, complete with illustrative, color-highlighted drawings, so the field and construction teams have unambiguous visibility of quantities and limits of work.

3. Professional summary  
   During the handover, it was confirmed that estimating provided the construction team with a full Bluebeam-style take-off. The deliverables include quantity sheets and a set of drawings with all scope items (e.g., WP08, WP10) clearly color-highlighted. Frank Jonathan verified that this “complete global takeoff” resides in the shared project folder, and KEL acknowledged that the construction team now has a 100 percent clear understanding of our scope. This ensures that field personnel can reference the same marked-up drawings and quantities that the estimators used to price and plan the work.
