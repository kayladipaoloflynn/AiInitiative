1. Direct quotes from the transcript that answer the question

   • “If you are the subcontractor, do you have the copy of prime contract?  
     Don’t have the copy of prime contract, I believe, yet. That will be requested.”  
     – KEL-WoodLake BR(10)(VC) at 35:23  

   • “Do we know if prime payment rules apply under provincial registration?  
     Are the payment terms and how long it will take for our invoice to be paid?  
     We don’t have the – I don’t believe we have the prompt payment rules yet.”  
     – KEL-WoodLake BR(10)(VC) at 36:00  

   • “Bonding, is the performing bond requirement required project?  
     Do we have bonding for this?  
     No, we don’t bonding.”  
     – KEL-WoodLake BR(10)(VC) at 37:03  

2. Expert interpretation of this information

   • Missing prime contract: Without the actual prime (general) contract in hand, the team cannot verify key terms and conditions—scope boundaries, change-order procedures, indemnity clauses, insurance requirements or any liquidated damages provisions. This gap exposes the subcontractor to unrecognized obligations or to scope items for which they cannot bill.  

   • Uncertain payment terms / prompt-payment legislation: Prompt-payment rules (and any related holdback or statutory lien deadlines) drive cash flow and risk of dispute. Not knowing whether provincial prompt-payment statutes apply, or what the exact payment interval or documentation requirements are, creates a risk that invoices may be rejected, delayed or paid short, leading to downstream cost of capital or potential liquidity issues.  

   • Bonding requirements: The discussion confirms there is no performance bond in place. If the prime contract actually requires a bond (for example under a public-sector owner), the subcontractor could face contract default or be unable to secure necessary sub-trade bonds. Conversely, having no bond requirement may limit subcontractor remedies if the general contractor becomes insolvent or fails to pay.  

   • Secondary risks tied to contract clarity:  
     – Material substitutions (e.g., use of FR-250 in place of SOPRA-INFLAM 180) were bid but may require written client approval to avoid non-conformance claims.  
     – Winter installation limits (cut-off temperatures for cap sheets and primer) were raised, but if not formally captured in a contract amendment or supplemental instruction, the subcontractor could be held to performance in unsuitable weather.  
     – Crane and mobilization allowances may not match the actual site crane availability or phasing, potentially triggering time-related extras that fall outside the agreed work order.  

3. Professional summary addressing contractual risks

   In reviewing the handoff transcript, the primary contractual risks stem from incomplete documentation of the prime contract, undefined payment terms, and the absence of bonding. The subcontractor has not yet obtained the signed prime agreement, so critical clauses—particularly those governing scope changes, payment triggers, holdbacks and potential liquidated damages—remain unverified. Prompt-payment or “pay-when-paid” conditions under provincial statute must be confirmed in writing to safeguard cash flow and avoid invoice rejections. The lack of a performance bond creates vulnerability should the general contractor default or the owner impose bonding requirements after award.  
   
   Secondary but material risks include unapproved material substitutions (e.g., higher-performance cap membranes), winter installation protocols that may not be contractually formalized, and allowances for crane use or multiple mobilizations that may not reflect actual site logistics. Each of these items should be addressed by:  
   - Securing and reviewing the complete prime contract (and any relevant amendments).  
   - Confirming payment intervals, holdbacks and prompt-payment legislation applicability in writing.  
   - Verifying whether a performance bond is contractually mandated and, if required, arranging bonding immediately.  
   - Documenting any scope changes (material substitutions, winter-rated primers) through formal change directives or allowances.  
   - Aligning mobilization/demobilization allowances with the client’s phasing plan and crane schedule to avoid unbillable extras.  
   
   Taking these steps will mitigate contractual exposure, ensure clarity of obligations, and preserve the subcontractor’s right to payment and risk relief under the agreement.
