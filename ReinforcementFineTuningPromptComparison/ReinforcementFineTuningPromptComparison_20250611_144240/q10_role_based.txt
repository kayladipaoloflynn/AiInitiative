1. Direct quotes from the transcript that answer the question  
   - KEL-WoodLake –BR(10)(VC) (31:27):  
     “Project scope the estimation team drawing, specification and estimate? My answer is yes. Everything was presented, the information at this point are clear.”  
   - KEL-WoodLake –BR(10)(VC) (32:09):  
     “Does the construction team have a 100% clear idea of what our complete scope is? Yes. At this point, there is no more questions. We have very little time to review this, but everything seems clear.”  

2. Expert interpretation of this information  
   Those two exchanges make it clear that the estimating group delivered a full set of hand‐over documents – complete drawings, specifications, and the full cost estimate – and that the construction team has reviewed them and feels they understand the entire scope.  While they flagged a few minor follow-up items (e.g. confirming fire-rated membrane on the concrete deck, winter-rated primers, prime contract, roof anchors), none of these represent missing foundational deliverables; they are normal clarifications as the project moves from estimate to execution.  

3. Professional summary  
   At the conclusion of the Dillworth Phase 1 handoff session, the team formally confirmed that the estimating department had conducted and provided a comprehensive overview of all project materials—drawings, specifications, and the detailed estimate—and that the construction group has a complete understanding of scope.  No critical documents were omitted; the only outstanding actions are standard confirmation steps (e.g. prime contract copy, certain material ratings, winter installation procedures) that will be resolved as the project advances toward mobilization.
