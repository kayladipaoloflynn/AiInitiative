1. Direct quotes from the transcript that answer the question  
- KEL-WoodLake-BR(10)(VC) (24:13): “So who is the customer for the project describe our past working any, are they any concern to not before proceedings?”  
- Respondent (around 24:18): “Me personally, I’ve never worked with the construction so I can’t comment on the relationship those. … haven’t worked either. It’s our first project with them.”  
- KEL-WoodLake-BR(10)(VC) (24:54): “We’ve got Brian Rich who is the project manager for Grayback. We’ve got Earl Faraguna who is the construction manager and Bob McAllister who is the superintendent. So this is the main context for us.”

2. Expert interpretation of this information  
• Customer identity: The primary customer (general contractor/construction manager) is Grayback (referred to in the transcript as “Grayback” and in work-order notes as Grayback Construction).  
• Key contacts: Brian Rich (Project Manager, Grayback), Earl Faraguna (Construction Manager), Bob McAllister (Superintendent) are the designated points of contact.  
• Past relationship: Neither the estimating nor the construction team has previous experience with Grayback. This engagement represents our first subcontract with them, so there is no established working history or prior performance record to draw on.

3. Professional summary  
The customer for the Dillworth Phase 1 roofing scope is Grayback Construction, with Brian Rich acting as Project Manager, Earl Faraguna as Construction Manager, and Bob McAllister as Superintendent. According to the project team, this is our first assignment with Grayback—there is no existing working relationship or past project experience together. Consequently, we should anticipate a steeper learning curve in client coordination and allow extra time for confirming communication protocols, document exchanges (such as the prime contract and payment terms), and any unique process requirements specific to Grayback.
