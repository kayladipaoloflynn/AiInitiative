1. Direct quotes from the transcript  
   • KEL-WoodLake-BR(10)(VC) – 37:03: “Bonding, is the performing bond requirement required project?”  
   • KEL-WoodLake-BR(10)(VC) – 37:04: “Do we have bonding for this?”  
   • Frank Jonathan – 37:05: “No, we don’t bonding.”  
   • KEL-WoodLake-BR(10)(VC) – 37:06: “No bonding? No bonding.”  

2. Expert interpretation  
   In the contract-review portion of the handover, the team explicitly raised the question of whether a performance (or “performing”) bond was contractually required. The back-and-forth confirms that no bonding package was included or anticipated under the prime contract as currently scoped. In other words, the subcontractor does not need to procure a performance bond for Dillworth Phase 1.  

3. Professional summary  
   During the handoff, the construction team reviewed key contractual requirements, including bonding. It was confirmed—through direct inquiry and response—that the prime contract does not call for a performance bond. Therefore, the subcontractor is not obligated to secure one for this project.
