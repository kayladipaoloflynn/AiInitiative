Full Answer:
============================================================
#### 1. RELEVANT QUOTES  
- Multiple speakers (timestamp ~33:11): “review or have project payroll attributes will be confirmed I say yes.”  
- KEL-WoodLake ‑BR(10)(VC) (timestamp ~33:19): “It appears be correct.”  

#### 2. ANALYSIS  
The first quote indicates that the team was asked whether the project payroll attributes had been reviewed and confirmed, and the response was “yes.” The follow-up comment—“It appears be correct.”—reinforces that, upon review, no issues were found and the payroll attributes are deemed accurate.

#### 3. GAPS OR MISSING INFORMATION  
- The transcript does not specify which payroll attributes were reviewed (e.g., labor rates, classifications, burden rates).  
- There is no detail about who specifically performed the review or what process/checklist was used.  

#### 4. FINAL ANSWER  
Yes. The transcript shows the team confirmed that project payroll attributes have been reviewed (“…will be confirmed I say yes.”) and that they appear to be correct.
