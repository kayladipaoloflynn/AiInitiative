============================================================
#### 1. RELEVANT QUOTES  
- KEL-WoodLake-BR(10)(VC) (28:14):  
  “So definitely Kevin and Cory, there will be a situation with multiple trades in our way. We'll have to coordinate leverage and making sure we've got the safety zone set up around all lifting equipment as soon as the perimeter of our work.”  
- Multiple speakers (28:39):  
  “And to add that, I you're working on wood deck lot of torch, so safety to be watched out for.”  
- KEL-WoodLake-BR(10)(VC) (28:53):  
  “the risk, working at heights, combustible products, place to minimize this risk? Picture framing current, all the penetrations, picture framing current, all parameters, all the combustibles will have to be removed from the working area the safety distance. Task swept and garbage picked. Working at the heights, we'll have our guardrail set up around the perimeter.”  
- Multiple speakers (29:35):  
  “No, again, nothing jumps out just looking but we'll have to actually see real site conditions when Okay, so to be reviewed.”  

#### 2. ANALYSIS  
These quotes show that the team has identified several key hazards:  
• Trade coordination risks – other trades and lifting equipment operating in the same zones could conflict with roofing work.  
• Hot-work risks – torching over a combustible wood deck requires special fire watch procedures and removal of nearby combustibles.  
• Fall hazards – working at height demands guardrails and clear perimeter controls.  
• Housekeeping risks – loose debris and penetrations must be managed to prevent fire or trip hazards.  
• Site-specific unknowns – while no other immediate issues were noted, all parties agree that a pre-start site review is needed to catch any unforeseen conditions.  

#### 3. GAPS OR MISSING INFORMATION  
- No detailed hot-work permit or fire-watch plan is on record (e.g., staffing, equipment, timing).  
- Specific sequencing or scheduling details with other trades (crane lifts, scaffold erection) are not provided.  
- No mention of required safety submittals or customer approval for the proposed safety zones and guardrail plan.  
- Environmental and weather-related constraints (e.g., winter-rated materials, wind‐uplift limits in cold conditions) are not discussed in this risk section.  

#### 4. FINAL ANSWER  
Yes. The project carries several underlying risks that should be raised with the customer before work begins:  
1. Coordination with multiple trades and cranes – a defined safety zone must be agreed upon to prevent interference and ensure clear lift paths.  
2. Hot‐work over a combustible wood deck – a formal hot‐work safety plan (permits, fire watches, removal of combustibles, debris control) must be approved by the customer.  
3. Fall protection – perimeter guardrails and means of egress at roof edges must be installed and signed off.  
4. Site‐specific verification – a pre-mobilization site walk is required to identify any additional hazards or site conditions not captured on the drawings.
