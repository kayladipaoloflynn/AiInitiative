============================================================
1. Direct quotes from the transcript  
   a) KEL-WoodLake (prompting input):  
      “Form and comments. What input or suggestion did Foreman have [regarding] installation?”  
   b) Kevin Trahan (the Foreman):  
      “Um, no, it seems like it should be fairly straightforward.”  
   c) Another attendee (affirming Foreman’s view on the drawings):  
      “I do like the color coding as—that should help a lot to know, uh, yeah.”  
   d) Later in the meeting, concern raised (attributed to the installation team/foreman group):  
      “It’s just the torching the wood is a little concerning, but you guys might need to change that to meet protocols.”  
      KEL-WoodLake’s follow-up: “That’s the only comment I would have.”  

2. Expert interpretation  
   – The Foreman’s initial feedback was that, from a manpower and coordination standpoint, the scope of work and installation sequence as presented are clear and pose no unusual challenges (“fairly straightforward”).  
   – The color-coded plans received positive feedback, indicating that the visual breakdown of roofing assemblies (by WP08, WP10, inverted, planters, etc.) will facilitate field layout and minimize installer confusion.  
   – The only substantive installation concern raised was the use of an open-flame torch on a combustible wood deck. The Foreman (and supporting team members) flagged this as a safety risk that must be addressed by either:  
     • Adopting stricter torching protocols (e.g., fire watch, flame-resistant blankets, hot-work permits), or  
     • Substituting a low-temperature adhesive or cold-apply membrane system in that area.  

3. Professional summary  
   The on-site Foreman confirmed that the overall installation plan is well understood and should proceed without major logistical obstacles. He praised the color-coded drawings for clarifying material transitions and roofing zones. His only actionable suggestion was to revisit the planned torch-applied membrane over the wood deck: because of the combustible substrate, the team must implement robust hot-work controls or consider a cold-adhesive alternative to ensure compliance with safety protocols. Beyond that, no further installation issues were identified.
