#### 1. RELEVANT QUOTES  
- KEL-WoodLake-BR(10)(VC) at 24:13: “So who is the customer for the project describe our past working any, are they any concern to not before proceedings?”  
- Attendee response at 24:23: “Me personally, I've never worked with the construction so I can't comment on the relationship those.”  
- KEL-WoodLake follow-up at 24:32: “I don't know attended more, any other estimates for those or you've got any experience with them?”  
- Attendee response at 24:38: “haven't worked either. It's our first project with them.”  

#### 2. ANALYSIS  
These exchanges establish that none of the team members have previously worked with this customer. As a result:  
- There is no firsthand knowledge of the customer’s reliability, communication style, or payment history.  
- No specific concerns or red flags about the customer’s behavior, capabilities, or financial standing were identified during the meeting.  

#### 3. GAPS OR MISSING INFORMATION  
The transcript does not include:  
- Any background on the customer’s reputation in the industry (e.g., references, prior project performance).  
- Information on the customer’s payment history, prompt-payment performance, or any disputes.  
- Details from the prime contract that might reveal special requirements or potential liabilities related to the customer.  

#### 4. FINAL ANSWER  
Based solely on the transcript, the only “concern” noted is that this is the team’s first engagement with the customer, and no prior working relationship exists. No specific negative issues or risks associated with the customer were raised during the handover meeting.
