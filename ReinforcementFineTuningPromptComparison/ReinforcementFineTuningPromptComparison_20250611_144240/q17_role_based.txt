============================================================
1. Direct quotes from the transcript that answer the question  
   - KEL-WoodLake-BR(10)(VC) (35:23): “contract been reviewed internally?”  
   - Unattributed speaker immediately thereafter: “that’s been reviewed, but our branch manager development manager as long as me for the details.”

2. Expert interpretation of this information  
   Those two lines tell us that, yes, the contract has already received an internal review.  The review was performed by the speaker in concert with the branch manager and the development manager.  However, as they later acknowledge, they still do not have a copy of the prime contract itself on file—which means certain prime-contract-specific requirements (prompt-payment rules, invoicing format, bonding obligations, etc.) have yet to be validated against the actual prime agreement.

3. Professional summary  
   The project team confirms that the contract has undergone an internal review by the operations leaders (branch manager, development manager and the handoff team lead).  All scope-of-work and standard deliverables have been checked for compliance with the bid documents.  Because the team is acting as a subcontractor, they do not yet possess the prime contract, so they will formally request that document to complete their due-diligence on payment terms, prime-contract conditions and any additional obligations before execution of work.
