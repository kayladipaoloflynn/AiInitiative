1. Direct quotes from the transcript  
   – KEL-WoodLake: “There will be a situation with multiple trades in our way. We’ll have to coordinate … making sure we’ve got the safety zone set up around all lifting equipment as soon as the perimeter of our work.”  
   – Multiple speakers: “And to add that, you’re working on wood deck, a lot of torch, so safety to be watched out for.”  
   – KEL-WoodLake: “Picture framing current, all the penetrations, picture framing current, all parameters, all the combustibles will have to be removed from the working area the safety distance. Task swept and garbage picked. Working at the heights, we’ll have our guardrail set up around the perimeter.”

2. Expert interpretation  
   – Coordination of multiple trades and lifting operations: by establishing a clearly marked “safety zone” around cranes and hoisting equipment, they intend to keep non-essential personnel clear of hazard areas and prevent accidental contact with suspended loads.  
   – Fire prevention for torch operations on combustible wood deck: they will enforce a combustible-free perimeter, removing loose debris and combustible materials to maintain the minimum safe distance around all hot-work. Continuous housekeeping (“task swept and garbage picked”) minimizes stray combustibles that could ignite.  
   – Fall protection for work at heights: installing perimeter guardrail systems around the roof edge provides a leading-edge barrier, reducing the likelihood of falls during installation, inspection, or maintenance tasks at elevation.

3. Professional summary  
   To address the twin hazards of fall risk and fire risk inherent to roofing on a wood deck with significant torch use, the project team will:  
   • Establish and enforce a controlled “safety zone” around all lifting equipment and hoist areas to segregate trades and prevent unintended access.  
   • Remove all combustible materials and debris from the hot-work area, maintaining clearances required for torch operations and conducting continuous housekeeping.  
   • Install guardrails around the roof perimeter to comply with fall-protection standards and provide a physical barrier at all unprotected edges.  
   Collectively, these measures—trade coordination, fire-safe work zones, strict combustible control, and perimeter fall protection—constitute a comprehensive approach to minimize risks associated with working at height and using torches on combustible substrates.
