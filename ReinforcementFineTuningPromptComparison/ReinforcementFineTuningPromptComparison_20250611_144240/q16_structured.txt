#### 1. RELEVANT QUOTES  
- KEL-WoodLake ‑BR(10)(VC) (34:19): “Does this project require cold water application procedures as recommended by the manufacturer?”  
- KEL-WoodLake ‑BR(10)(VC) (34:26–35:01):  
  “So as we will be starting this project in October, we'll be probably running into late, you know, late or in the winter and proceeding through the winter with that. So we'll definitely have some limitations with the With the cap stripping installation, like the cut-off is zero degree, I'll have to make sure that the customer aware of that. We'll have to use a winter rated product, so winter rated primers for the SOPRA VAP. This we can install to minus 10, which is good. We'll at least get them more waterti ght for the time being. But yes, there is a high chance that we'll have to use the winter rated product for this project.”  

#### 2. ANALYSIS  
- The team anticipates roofing work extending into winter conditions, which triggers manufacturer-recommended cold-weather procedures.  
- The “cap stripping installation” has a manufacturer-specified cut-off temperature of 0 °C; below this temperature the standard application is not permitted.  
- To accommodate colder conditions, they plan to switch to “winter rated primers for the SOPRA VAP,” which are certified for use down to –10 °C.  

#### 3. GAPS OR MISSING INFORMATION  
- Exact product names or technical data sheets for the winter-rated primers are not provided.  
- No mention of other cold-weather measures (e.g., surface pre-heating, wind breaks, extended cure times).  
- It is not confirmed whether the manufacturer’s formal cold-weather installation guidelines have been reviewed or obtained.  

#### 4. FINAL ANSWER  
Yes. The project will require cold-weather application procedures. Specifically:  
- The bituminous cap installation cannot proceed below 0 °C.  
- A winter-rated primer must be used for the SOPRA VAP membrane system, which allows application down to –10 °C.
