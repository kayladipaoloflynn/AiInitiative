#### 1. RELEVANT QUOTES  
- KEL-WoodLake-BR(10)(VC) (36:29): “What documentation information must be submitted with invoice?  
  So, definitely the progress report and the schedule of values will accompany each of the invoices.”  

#### 2. ANALYSIS  
From this exchange, the team was clarifying what back‐up materials must be sent along with every billing submission. The response explicitly identifies two items—  
  • A progress report  
  • A schedule of values  
These are the only documents mentioned in the transcript as mandatory attachments to each invoice.

#### 3. GAPS OR MISSING INFORMATION  
- The transcript does not specify the required format, level of detail, or frequency of updates for the progress report.  
- It does not describe the structure or breakdown required in the schedule of values.  
- No other customary billing attachments (e.g., lien waivers, certified payroll records, tax forms, draft invoice requirements) are mentioned.  
- There is no confirmation whether any additional project‐specific or contract‐specified forms must accompany the invoice.

#### 4. FINAL ANSWER  
Based solely on the transcript, each invoice must be submitted with:  
  1. A progress report  
  2. A schedule of values
