1. Direct quotes from the transcript  
   • KEL-WoodLake-BR(10)(VC) at 27:01:  
     “Have any alternate materials included for work specification? Do we need to bring this to attention of the client/customer before starting? So, items to be confirmed would be roof anchors were shown as a bidding.”  
   • Frank Jonathan at 27:33:  
     “Apart from that, I don’t see any other confirmed as everything letter.”  

2. Expert interpretation  
   In the handover the only alternates called out for separate confirmation were the roof anchors that had been shown as bid-phase alternates.  The team confirmed that all other products and assemblies are standard, stock items in accordance with the specifications.  Thus, the roof anchors represent the sole alternate requiring formal client sign-off prior to mobilization.  

3. Professional summary  
   During the phase-1 handover it was specifically noted that roof anchors had been treated as an alternate in the bidding process.  The team agreed that no other non-standard materials or assemblies had been included that would fall outside the published specifications.  Best practice is to flag the roof anchors to the client or prime contractor for written confirmation—verifying location, type and quantities—before ordering or installation begins.  All remaining materials and system components are standard, spec-compliant products and do not require further “alternate” approval.
