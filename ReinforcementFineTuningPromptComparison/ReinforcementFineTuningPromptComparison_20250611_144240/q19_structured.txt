#### 1. RELEVANT QUOTES  
1. “If you are the subcontractor, do you have the copy of prime contract? If not, request the copy of the prime contract.” — KEL-WoodLake-BR(10)(VC) at 35:23  
2. “don’t have the copy of prime contract, I believe, yet. That will be requested.” — response immediately following the question  

#### 2. ANALYSIS  
– The project team explicitly checks whether the subcontractor holds the prime contract (“If you are the subcontractor, do you have the copy of prime contract?”).  
– The immediate reply confirms that the subcontractor does not currently have that document (“don’t have the copy… yet”) and states an intention to obtain it (“That will be requested”).  

#### 3. GAPS OR MISSING INFORMATION  
– The transcript does not identify who on the subcontractor’s side will be responsible for requesting the prime contract.  
– There is no stated timeline or deadline by which the prime contract request must be fulfilled.  
– The method or point of contact for requesting the prime contract (e.g., the general contractor, owner, or contract administrator) is not specified.  

#### 4. FINAL ANSWER  
Based on the transcript, as the subcontractor we do not yet have a copy of the prime contract. It has been acknowledged that “That will be requested,” so the next step is to formally request the prime contract from the appropriate party.
