1. Direct quotes from the transcript  
  - KEL-WoodLake -BR(10)(VC) (around 36:00): “Does the contract specify requirements proper invoice?”  
  - Multiple speakers immediately thereafter: “What information must be included in our invoice?”  
  - KEL-WoodLake -BR(10)(VC): “What documentation information must be submitted with invoice? So, definitely the progress report and the schedule of values will accompany each of the invoices.”  
  - KEL-WoodLake -BR(10)(VC): “If so, draft need to be submitted? What information must be provided in the draft invoice? That’s applicable, I believe, at this yet.”  
  - KEL-WoodLake -BR(10)(VC) (just prior): “If you are the subcontractor, do you have the copy of prime contract? If not, request the copy of the prime contract.”

2. Expert interpretation  
  - The team explicitly asked whether the prime contract defines what constitutes a proper invoice, but they had not yet located or reviewed those provisions.  
  - In lieu of contract language, they defaulted to standard practice—attaching a progress report and schedule of values to each billing.  
  - They recognize that draft invoices or additional supporting information may be required, but have not confirmed specifics because they do not yet have the prime contract or prompt-payment rules in hand.  
  - The absence of a definitive answer in the discussion indicates that the contract’s invoice requirements remain unverified and must be confirmed once the prime contract documentation is obtained.

3. Professional summary  
  At this handover meeting, the construction team questioned whether the contract details the form and content requirements for a proper invoice. No explicit contract language was identified during the call. In the interim, the team agreed to attach a progress report and schedule of values to each invoice as a best practice. They also noted potential requirements for a draft invoice or other supporting data but were unable to specify those elements until they receive and review the prime contract and any applicable prompt-payment regulations. The next step is to secure the prime contract document, confirm invoice format requirements, payment terms, and any prompt-payment rules, and then communicate those obligations clearly to the billing team before work commences.
