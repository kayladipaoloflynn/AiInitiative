Full Answer:
============================================================
1. Direct quotes from the transcript  
   • KEL-WoodLake (at 35:23): “If you are the subcontractor, do you have the copy of prime contract? If not, request the copy of the prime contract.”  
   • Unspecified speaker (immediately following): “don’t have the copy of prime contract, I believe, yet. That will be requested.”

2. Expert interpretation  
   • At no point in the handover discussion did anyone read out or reference the actual date of the Prime Contract.  
   • The team explicitly acknowledged that they do not yet have a copy of the Prime Contract on file and pledged to request it.  
   • Because the document was not available to the group during the meeting, no date could be confirmed or recorded in the transcript.

3. Professional summary  
   The transcript does not provide a date for the Prime Contract. During the “contract review” portion of the discussion, the team confirmed they do not yet possess the Prime Contract and must formally request it from the client or main contractor. To establish the Prime Contract date, the project team’s next step is to obtain the document itself. Once in hand, the Prime Contract will contain the definitive execution or effective date. Without that document, the date remains unknown.
