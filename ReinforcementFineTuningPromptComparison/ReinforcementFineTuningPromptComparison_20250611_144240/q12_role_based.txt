1. Direct quotes from the transcript  
   • KEL-WoodLake (32:09):  
     “Does the construction team have a 100% clear idea of what our complete scope is?”  
   • Multiple speakers (immediately following):  
     “Yes. At this point, there is no more questions. We have very little time to review this, but everything seems clear.”  

2. Expert interpretation  
   After a line-by-line review of assemblies (WP08, WP10, WP04/04A, planters, canopies, inverted roof sections, etc.), material specifications (membranes, insulations, cap sheets, flashing components, metal interfaces), installation details (picture framing, membrane terminations, crane allowances, winter-rated primers) and administrative requirements (warranty letters, wind-uplift calculations, payment and bonding provisions), the field and estimating teams voiced unambiguous confidence that they fully understand every element of their roofing scope for Dillworth Phase 1A/B. Their “yes” reflects that all major technical, logistical and contractual deliverables were addressed during the handoff, with only routine confirmation items (roof anchors, prime contract, site-specific coordination and final safety checks) outstanding.  

3. Professional summary  
   The construction team has affirmed that they have a complete, end-to-end understanding of the roofing scope for Dillworth Phase 1A and 1B. They have reviewed and accepted:  
   – All conventional and inverted roof assemblies and material sequences as per the drawings and specifications.  
   – Key installation details, including picture framing, flashings, and membrane terminations around parapets, planters, canopies and service pathways.  
   – Required performance criteria (system warranty, wind-uplift values, winter application limits) and the necessary design submittals (manufacturer’s design letter, wind uplift calculations).  
   – Logistical considerations such as crane usage allowances, mobilization/demobilization hours, and safety protocols for torch application on a combustible deck.  
   – Administrative measures, including progress reporting, invoicing requirements, and pending confirmation of prime contract terms and roof anchor details.  

   With these components thoroughly addressed in the handoff meeting, the team confirmed there are no substantive gaps in their scope understanding and are prepared to move forward into the execution phase.
