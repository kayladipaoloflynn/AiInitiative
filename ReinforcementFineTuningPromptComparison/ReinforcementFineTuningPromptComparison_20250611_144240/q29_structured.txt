Full Answer:
============================================================
#### 1. RELEVANT QUOTES  
- “Do we have bonding for this?”  
- “No, we don’t bonding.”  
- “No bonding?”  
- “No bonding.”  

#### 2. ANALYSIS  
In this exchange, the team explicitly discusses whether any bonding (i.e., a performance bond) is required for the project. The repeated questions and answers confirm that no bonding has been carried or is planned: when asked “Do we have bonding for this?”, the response is first “No, we don’t bonding,” and then reiterated as “No bonding.” This indicates that the project does not include a requirement for a performance bond.

#### 3. GAPS OR MISSING INFORMATION  
- The transcript does not reference the prime contract or its terms, which would definitively state bonding requirements.  
- There is no mention of any legal or client-mandated performance bond clauses from the contract documents.  
- It is unclear if this lack of bonding is due to a contractual waiver, a client decision, or an oversight in the estimate.

#### 4. FINAL ANSWER  
Based solely on the transcript, a performance bond is not required for this project.
