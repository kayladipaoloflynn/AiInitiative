#### 1. RELEVANT QUOTES  
1) KEL-WoodLake-BR(10)(VC) – 27:01  
   “Have any alternate materials included for work specification?  
    Do we need to bring this to the attention of the client/customer before starting?  
    So, items to be confirmed would be roof anchors were shown as a bidding.”  
2) Frank Jonathan – 27:33  
   “Apart from that, I don’t see any other confirmed as everything letter.”  

#### 2. ANALYSIS  
- KEL-WoodLake explicitly asks whether any alternates in the spec require client notification prior to mobilization, and immediately identifies that “roof anchors” were shown as an alternate in the bid.  
- Frank Jonathan’s response indicates that, beyond the roof anchors, no other alternates or variances from the base specification have been identified that would need customer sign-off.  

#### 3. GAPS OR MISSING INFORMATION  
- The transcript does not detail the nature or specification of the roof-anchor alternate (e.g., type, performance differences).  
- It is not stated whether formal written approval is required from the client or if a verbal confirmation will suffice.  
- There is no mention of a process or form (e.g., submittal log, RFI) to document the client’s acceptance of alternates.  

#### 4. FINAL ANSWER  
Based on the transcript, the only alternate material that must be brought to the client’s attention before starting is the roof anchors that were shown as an alternate in the bid. No other alternates were identified by the team as requiring client notification.
