1. Direct quotes from the transcript  
   • KEL-WoodLake-BR(10)(VC) (34:19): “Does this project require cold weather application procedures as recommended by the manufacturer?”  
   • KEL-WoodLake-BR(10)(VC) (34:26): “So as we will be starting this project in October, we’ll be probably running into late, you know, late or in the winter and proceeding through the winter with that.  So we’ll definitely have some limitations with the With the cap stripping installation, like the cut‐off is zero degree, I’ll have to make sure that the customer aware of that.  We’ll have to use a winter rated product, so winter rated primers for the SOPRA VAP.  This we can install to minus 10, which is good.  We’ll at least get them more waterti ght for the time being.  But yes, there is a high chance that we’ll have to use the winter rated product for this project.”  

2. Expert interpretation  
   • The team recognizes that because roofing work begins in mid-October and extends into colder months, standard hot-applied or torch-applied cap sheets cannot be installed below the manufacturer’s specified temperature.  In this case, the “cut-off” temperature for standard cap-sheet installation is 0 °C.  
   • To meet the manufacturer’s cold-weather requirements for the SOPRA VAP membrane, a winter-rated primer must be applied.  The winter-rated SOPRA VAP primer is certified for application at ambient and substrate temperatures down to –10 °C, thereby extending the workable season and ensuring membrane adhesion and watertightness under cold conditions.  

3. Professional summary  
   Yes.  Because roofing operations will continue into the winter months, the manufacturer’s cold-weather application procedures must be followed.  Specifically:  
   – Do not install SBS cap sheets when the ambient or deck temperature is at or below 0 °C.  
   – Switch to a winter-rated primer for the SOPRA VAP base membrane.  This primer permits safe and effective adhesion in temperatures as low as –10 °C.  
   All parties—contractor, client and field crews—must be made aware of these temperature limits, have the winter-grade primers on site, and schedule membrane application only when conditions meet the manufacturer’s minimum temperature requirements.
