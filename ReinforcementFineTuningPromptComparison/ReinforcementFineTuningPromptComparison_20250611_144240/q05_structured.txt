============================================================
#### 1. RELEVANT QUOTES  
- KEL-WoodLake ‑BR(10)(VC) (26:34): “Have any alternate materials included for work specification? Do we need to bring this to attention of the client customer before starting?”  
- Frank Jonathan (27:33): “Apart from that, I don’t see any other confirmed as everything letter.”  

#### 2. ANALYSIS  
The only direct discussion of alternate materials occurs when KEL-WoodLake asks if any have been included in the spec and whether the client needs to be notified. Frank’s immediate response indicates that, beyond the items already covered (anchors, wind uplift, etc.), there are no additional materials “confirmed.” No specific alternate products or substitutions are ever listed or described elsewhere in the transcript.

#### 3. GAPS OR MISSING INFORMATION  
- Frank’s reply is terse and does not explicitly say “no alternates were included,” only that he doesn’t see any other confirmed.  
- There is no follow-up to clarify whether items like the OLSAN RS230 liquid membrane or fire-rated cap options were considered alternates or simply miscellaneous allowances.  
- The transcript contains no list of potential alternates, nor any recorded client approvals or rejections of substitutes.

#### 4. FINAL ANSWER  
Based solely on this transcript, no alternate materials were formally included in the scope of work or specification. Frank Jonathan’s comment that he “doesn’t see any other confirmed” implies that nothing beyond the originally specified products was incorporated as an alternate.
