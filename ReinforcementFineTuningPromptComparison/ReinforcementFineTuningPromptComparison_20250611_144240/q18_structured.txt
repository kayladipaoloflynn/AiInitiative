#### 1. RELEVANT QUOTES  
- “If you are the subcontractor, do you have the copy of prime contract?” (KEL-WoodLake-BR(10)(VC) – 35:23)  
- “We don’t have the copy of prime contract, I believe, yet. That will be requested.” (Frank Jonathan – 35:28)  
- “Do we know if prime payment rules apply under provincial registration?” (KEL-WoodLake-BR(10)(VC) – 35:45)  
- “We don’t have the prompt payment rules yet, but … Does the contract specify requirements proper invoice? What information must be included in our invoice?” (KEL-WoodLake-BR(10)(VC) – 36:00)  
- “Progress report and the schedule of values will accompany each of the invoices.” (KEL-WoodLake-BR(10)(VC) – 36:29)  
- “Bonding, is the performing bond requirement required project? Do we have bonding for this? No, we don’t bonding. No bonding.” (KEL-WoodLake-BR(10)(VC) – 37:03)  

#### 2. ANALYSIS  
These quotes show several areas where contractual obligations remain unclear or undocumented:  
- The team has not yet obtained or reviewed the prime contract, so they lack visibility into key terms such as payment provisions, change-order procedures, notice requirements, insurance obligations, warranty obligations, indemnities, liquidated damages, and dispute resolution mechanisms.  
- They have not confirmed whether local “prompt payment” statutes apply, nor do they know the contract’s required invoice format or documentation beyond a progress report and schedule of values. Without that information, invoices could be rejected or delayed.  
- No performance or payment bond is in place—if the prime contract or owner requires bonding, failing to secure it could constitute default.  

Each of these gaps constitutes a contractual risk: noncompliance with unreviewed contract terms, delayed or withheld payments due to improper invoicing, and potential default for missing bonds.  

#### 3. GAPS OR MISSING INFORMATION  
- The actual prime contract itself and its specific clauses (payment terms, milestones, retention, change-order process, indemnity, insurance, termination rights).  
- Confirmation of prompt-payment rules, timeframes for invoicing and payment, and any holdback or retention requirements.  
- Detailed invoice requirements (format, numbering, supporting documents beyond progress reports and schedule of values).  
- Whether a performance bond or payment bond is contractually mandated.  
- Any liquidated damages or penalty provisions.  
- Dispute resolution mechanism (mediation, arbitration, courts).  
- Insurance coverage requirements (types and limits).  

#### 4. FINAL ANSWER  
Based solely on the transcript, the primary contractual risks are:  
1. The subcontractor does not yet have or has not reviewed the prime contract, leaving all contract terms—including payment provisions, notice requirements, change-order procedures, and bond requirements—undetermined.  
2. It is unclear whether prompt-payment rules apply or what the exact invoicing requirements are, which could lead to invoice rejection or payment delays.  
3. No performance or payment bond is in place, which may breach prime contract requirements if bonding is mandated.  

Until the prime contract is obtained and its terms verified, these unknowns represent significant contractual risk.
