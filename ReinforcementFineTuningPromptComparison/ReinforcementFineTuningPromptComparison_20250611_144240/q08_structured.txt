============================================================
#### 1. RELEVANT QUOTES  
1. KEL-WoodLake –BR(10)(VC) (00:28:14):  
   “definitely Kevin and Cory, there will be a situation with multiple trades in our way. We’ll have to coordinate leverage and making sure we’ve got the safety zone set up around all lifting equipment as soon as the perimeter of our work.”  
2. Multiple speakers (00:28:39):  
   “And to add that, you’re working on wood deck, lot of torch, so safety to be watched out for.”  
3. KEL-WoodLake –BR(10)(VC) (00:28:53):  
   “Picture framing current, all the penetrations, picture framing current, all parameters, all the combustibles will have to be removed from the working area the safety distance. Task swept and garbage picked. Working at the heights, we’ll have our guardrail set up around the perimeter.”  

#### 2. ANALYSIS  
– Coordination and safety zones: The team recognizes that multiple trades and heavy lifting (cranes, hoists) will be operating simultaneously. They plan to “coordinate leverage” and establish a “safety zone … around all lifting equipment” at the roof perimeter to keep other crews clear of hazard areas.  
– Fire/combustible risk on wood deck: Acknowledging torch‐applied membranes on a combustible wood deck, they stress the need for enhanced fire safety oversight (“safety to be watched out for”).  
– Removal of combustibles: All loose combustible materials near torch‐applied or other hot‐work operations will be cleared to a safe distance. Work areas will be “swept” and debris (“garbage”) removed to prevent accidental ignition.  
– Guardrail protection for working at heights: To mitigate fall hazards, guardrails will be installed around the entire working perimeter.  

#### 3. GAPS OR MISSING INFORMATION  
- Specific distances for “safety zone” around lifting equipment and combustibles.  
- Details on fire watch procedures (e.g., fire watch personnel, frequency of inspections).  
- Specifications for the guardrails (height, strength, compliance standards).  
- Any use of personal fall‐arrest systems or tie‐off points beyond passive guardrails.  
- Confirmation of hot‐work permits or related administrative controls.  

#### 4. FINAL ANSWER  
Based on the transcript, the project team is putting in place the following precautions to minimize the risks of working at heights and with combustible products:  
- They will establish and strictly enforce a dedicated safety zone around all lifting equipment and at the roof perimeter to keep other trades clear of potential strike or collapse zones.  
- Prior to any torch work on the combustible wood deck, all loose combustibles in the vicinity will be removed to a safe buffer distance, and the work area will be kept clean by sweeping up debris and disposing of trash promptly.  
- Continuous fire‐watch vigilance will be implied (“safety to be watched out for”) during hot‐work operations, although specific fire watch procedures are not detailed.  
- To protect against falls, guardrails will be installed around the entire roof perimeter wherever work at height occurs.
