============================================================
#### 1. RELEVANT QUOTES  
- KEL-WoodLake-BR(10)(VC) – 25:20: “Schedule review was the project construction schedule expected our scope.”  
- Multiple speakers – 25:20: “The start roofing is scheduled for 13th of October 2025. And the project is scheduled for 128 crew with total crew.”

#### 2. ANALYSIS  
The exchange shows that during the handover discussion the team reviewed the construction schedule as it pertains to the roofing scope. The only explicit schedule information given is the planned start date for roofing: October 13, 2025. The second clause referencing “128 crew with total crew” appears to relate to manpower allocation (crew size or crew-days) rather than a completion date.

#### 3. GAPS OR MISSING INFORMATION  
- No explicit expected completion date or timeframe for our scope is provided.  
- It is unclear whether “128 crew with total crew” refers to total crew‐days, crew size, or another metric.  
- Any intermediate milestones or phased completion dates are not mentioned.

#### 4. FINAL ANSWER  
Based solely on the transcript, roofing work under our scope is scheduled to begin on October 13, 2025. An expected completion date for our scope is not mentioned in the transcript.
