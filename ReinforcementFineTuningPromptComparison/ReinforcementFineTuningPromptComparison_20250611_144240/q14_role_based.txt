============================================================
1. Direct quotes from the transcript  
   - “Multiple speakers – 33:11  review or have project payroll attributes will be confirmed I say yes.”  
   - “KEL-WoodLake-BR(10)(VC) – 33:19  It appears be correct.”

2. Expert interpretation  
   Those exchange lines show that the handoff team explicitly paused to verify the “project payroll attributes,” one participant answered “yes” when asked if they’d been confirmed, and immediately afterward the branch representative added “It appears be correct.” In construction handoffs the payroll attributes section typically covers labor classifications, burden rates, crew sizes, and other payroll-related inputs into the schedule of values and cost tracking. By verbally confirming “yes” and then stating “It appears be correct,” the group acknowledges they have reviewed those inputs and found no discrepancies at this stage.

3. Professional summary  
   During the scope-to-work-order review the team stopped to ensure that the project payroll attributes had been reviewed and validated. A participant confirmed that the attributes were indeed confirmed, and the branch lead verified that they appear accurate. No further action was flagged, indicating that for now the labor classifications, burden rates, crew hours and related payroll inputs have been checked and deemed correct in the handover documentation.
