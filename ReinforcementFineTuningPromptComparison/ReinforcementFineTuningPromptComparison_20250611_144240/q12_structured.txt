#### 1. RELEVANT QUOTES  
- KEL-WoodLake-BR(10)(VC) (32:09): “Does the construction team have a 100% clear idea of what our complete scope is?”  
- Multiple speakers (immediately following): “yes.”  
- KEL-WoodLake-BR(10)(VC) (32:12): “At this point, there is no more questions.”  
- KEL-WoodLake-BR(10)(VC) (32:13): “We have very little time review this, but everything seems clear.”

#### 2. ANALYSIS  
The construction team was explicitly asked if they had a “100% clear idea” of the complete scope, and the immediate, unqualified response was “yes.” The follow-up comment—“At this point, there is no more questions. We have very little time review this, but everything seems clear.”—indicates that despite time constraints, the team felt adequately informed and had no outstanding uncertainties concerning their responsibilities and deliverables.

#### 3. GAPS OR MISSING INFORMATION  
- There is no direct confirmation in the transcript that the team reviewed or referenced the prime contract to validate the scope.  
- The transcript does not record any verification against client-provided documents (e.g., prime contract, scope of work attachments) to ensure full alignment.  
- No mention of formal sign-off or documentation of scope acceptance (e.g., a signed scope checklist or official handover document).  
- Potential scope changes or pending client approvals (e.g., on primer types, anchor confirmations) were noted elsewhere but not explicitly tied to this scope-clarity question.

#### 4. FINAL ANSWER  
Based solely on the exchange in the transcript, the construction team affirmed that they have a 100% clear understanding of the complete scope. They indicated no further questions and stated that everything “seems clear,” even though they acknowledged limited time for review.
