1. Direct transcript excerpts  
- KEL-WoodLake-BR(10)(VC) (36:29–36:34):  
  “Do we need to submit a draft invoice before we submit our action invoice?  
   If so, draft need to be submitted? What information must be provided in the draft invoice?”  
- KEL-WoodLake-BR(10)(VC) (36:35–36:36):  
  “That’s applicable, I believe, at this yet.”

2. Expert interpretation  
During the invoicing review the team confirmed that each progress invoice must be accompanied by a progress report and a schedule of values. They then raised the question of whether a preliminary “draft invoice” is required in advance of the formal billing. The only response recorded—“That’s applicable, I believe, at this yet”—indicates that no draft-invoice procedure has been established or is currently in force. In other words, the contract requirements for invoicing have not yet been defined to the point of mandating a draft invoice or setting a submission deadline for it.

3. Professional summary  
At the February 11 handover meeting the team reviewed invoicing requirements and confirmed that each progress invoice must include (at a minimum) the project’s progress report and the schedule of values. When asked if a draft invoice must be submitted in advance of the actual billing, the group acknowledged that no such requirement has been specified to date (“That’s applicable, I believe, at this yet”). Consequently, there is currently no obligation to submit a draft invoice, nor is there a defined deadline for one. If the contract or prime-contract terms ultimately call for a draft submittal, those details will need to be obtained from the prime agreement or clarified with the client before billing commences.
