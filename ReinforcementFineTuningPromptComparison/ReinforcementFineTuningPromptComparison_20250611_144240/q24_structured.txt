#### 1. RELEVANT QUOTES  
- KEL-WoodLake ‑BR(10)(VC) ‑ 36:26  
  “Does the contract specify requirements proper invoice?”  
- Multiple speakers ‑ 36:26  
  “What information must be included in our invoice?”  
- KEL-WoodLake ‑BR(10)(VC) ‑ 36:29  
  “What documentation information must be submitted with invoice?”  
- Multiple speakers ‑ 36:29  
  “So, definitely the progress report and the schedule of values will accompany each of the invoices.”  
- Multiple speakers ‑ 36:29  
  “Do we need to submit a draft invoice before we submit our action invoice? If so, draft need to be submitted? What information must be provided in the draft invoice?”  
- Multiple speakers ‑ 36:29 (approximate)  
  “That’s applicable, I believe, at this yet.”  

#### 2. ANALYSIS  
The transcript shows that the team explicitly posed the question “Does the contract specify requirements proper invoice?” and followed up by asking what must be included in an invoice and what supporting documentation is required. The only specifics they identify are that every invoice “will accompany” a progress report and a schedule of values. There is no direct reference to a clause or section of the contract that defines these invoice requirements, nor is there a clear statement that the contract itself mandates those items. The question about submitting a draft invoice likewise goes unanswered beyond “That’s applicable, I believe, at this yet,” indicating uncertainty.

#### 3. GAPS OR MISSING INFORMATION  
- No citation of contract language or clause that outlines invoicing requirements.  
- No definitive answer confirming whether the contract actually contains these requirements.  
- No detail on format, timing, or other standard invoice components (e.g., invoice numbering, certification, prime contract reference) as prescribed by the contract.  

#### 4. FINAL ANSWER  
The transcript records the question “Does the contract specify requirements proper invoice?” but does not provide any direct answer or reference to actual contract provisions. The only guidance offered is that invoices should include a progress report and a schedule of values, but it is not confirmed that these items are mandated by the contract itself. Therefore, based solely on the transcript, whether the contract specifies invoice requirements remains unconfirmed.
