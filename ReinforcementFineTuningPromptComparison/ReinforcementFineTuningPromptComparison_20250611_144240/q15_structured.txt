2. Multiple speakers (immediately following):  
   “Yes.”  
3. KEL-WoodLake ‑BR(10)(VC) (33:23):  
   “So we’ve got in PIO?”  
4. Multiple speakers (33:24):  
   “Yeah, in the design review folder.”

#### 2. ANALYSIS  
– The question “Did we obtain that design letter?” clearly refers to a manufacturer’s design system letter meeting warranty requirements and providing the adhesive/fastening pattern.  
– The immediate affirmative response (“Yes.”) indicates that such a letter has indeed been obtained.  
– The follow-up confirms its location: the letter is stored in the “design review folder” in PIO.

#### 3. GAPS OR MISSING INFORMATION  
- The transcript does not explicitly state that the design letter meets all applicable building code requirements, only that it meets the manufacturer’s warranty requirements.  
- No details are provided about the actual adhesive or fastening patterns contained within the letter (e.g., quantities, layout, specific fastener types).  
- There is no mention of any third-party review or approval of the design letter for code compliance.

#### 4. FINAL ANSWER  
Based solely on the transcript, yes—the manufacturer’s design system letter, which covers warranty requirements and includes the adhesive/fastening pattern, has been obtained and is available in the “design review folder.”
