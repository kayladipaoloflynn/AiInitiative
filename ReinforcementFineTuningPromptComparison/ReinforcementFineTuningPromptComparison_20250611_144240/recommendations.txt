PROMPT ENGINEERING RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

Based on the comparison analysis, here are specific recommendations:

1. STRUCTURED APPROACH works better for:
   - What information must be included in our invoice?

2. ROLE-BASED APPROACH works better for:
   - Who is the customer for this project and describe our past working  relationship, if any?
   - Are there any concerns to note about the customer before proceeding?
   - What is the project construction schedule (start and expected completion) for our scope?

3. HYBRID APPROACH SUGGESTION:
Consider combining the best of both approaches:
- Use role-based framing for context
- Include structured sections for clarity
- Maintain requirement for exact quotes
- Add explicit gap identification
