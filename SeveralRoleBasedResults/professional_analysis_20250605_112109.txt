  - It was noted that the subcontractor does not currently have a copy of the prime contract. This is crucial for understanding the full scope and obligations.
  - **KEL-WoodLake -BR(10)(VC):** "I don't have the copy of prime contract, I believe, yet. That will be requested."

#### Recommendations:

- **Request Prime Contract:**
  - As a subcontractor, it is essential to obtain a copy of the prime contract to ensure alignment with the main contractor's expectations and obligations.
  
- **Clarify Material Specifications:**
  - Confirm with the client any changes in material specifications to avoid discrepancies during installation.

- **Safety Protocols:**
  - Review and reinforce safety protocols, especially concerning the use of combustible materials and working at heights.

- **Coordinate with Trades:**
