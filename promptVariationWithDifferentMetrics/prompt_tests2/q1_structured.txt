Answer:
DIRECT ANSWER: This is Flynn's first project with Grayback Construction, so there is no past working relationship to describe.

EVIDENCE:
Dariusz: "Me personally, I've never worked with the construction so I can't comment on the relationship those."
Frank: "I don't know attended more, any other estimates for those or you've got any experience with them?"
Dariusz: "haven't worked either. It's our first project with them."

ADDITIONAL CONTEXT: The main contacts at Grayback Construction for this project are:
- Brian Rich, Project Manager 
- Earl Faraguna, Construction Manager
- Bob McAllister, Superintendent

MISSING INFO: No other details are provided about Grayback Construction as a company or their reputation in the industry, since this is Flynn's first time working with them.
