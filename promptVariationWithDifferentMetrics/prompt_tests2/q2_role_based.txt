Answer:
Based on the discussion, there are a few key risks identified with performing the roofing work on this project:

1. Multiple trades working in the same areas, requiring coordination and safety zones around lifting equipment and work perimeters. As Kevin stated: "there will be a situation with multiple trades in our way. We'll have to coordinate leverage and making sure we've got the safety zone set up around all lifting equipment as soon as the perimeter of our work."

2. Working on wood decks with a lot of torch-applied materials poses a safety risk that needs to be monitored closely. Frank mentioned: "to add that, I you're working on wood deck lot of torch, so safety to be watched out for."

3. Working at heights will require proper guardrails to be set up around roof perimeters. 

4. Cold weather application procedures may be needed as the work extends into late fall/winter. Dariusz noted: "So we'll definitely have some limitations with the With the cap stripping installation, like the cut-off is zero degree, I'll have to make sure that the customer aware of that. We'll have to use a winter rated product, so winter rated primers for the SOPRA VAP."

5. Cory flagged torching on wood as concerning and not meeting protocols, stating it may need to change: "Uh, yeah, it's just the torching the wood is a little concerning, but you guys might need to change that to meet protocols."
