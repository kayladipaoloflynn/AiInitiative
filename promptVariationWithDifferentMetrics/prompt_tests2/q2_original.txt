Answer:
Based on the transcript, there are a few key underlying risks associated with performing the work on this project:

1. There will likely be multiple trades working in the same areas, which will require coordination and ensuring safety zones are set up around lifting equipment and work perimeters. As Kevin mentioned, "there will be a situation with multiple trades in our way. We'll have to coordinate leverage and making sure we've got the safety zone set up around all lifting equipment as soon as the perimeter of our work."

2. The roofing work involves a lot of torch application on wood decks, which poses a safety risk that needs to be monitored closely. As Frank noted, "you're working on wood deck lot of torch, so safety to be watched out for."

3. The project involves working at heights, so proper safety precautions like guardrails around roof perimeters will be critical. Dariusz stated: "Working at the heights, we'll have our guardrail set up around the perimeter."
