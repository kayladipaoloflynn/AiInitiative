Answer:
Here are the relevant quotes about underlying risks on this project:

KEL-WoodLake-BR(10)(VC): "So definitely Kevin and Cory, there will be a situation with multiple trades in our way. We'll have to coordinate leverage and making sure we've got the safety zone set up around all lifting equipment as soon as the perimeter of our work."

Multiple speakers: "And to add that, I you're working on wood deck lot of torch, so safety to be watched out for."

KEL-WoodLake-BR(10)(VC): "the risk, working at heights, combustible products, place to minimize this risk? Picture framing current, all the penetrations, picture framing current, all parameters, all the combustibles will have to be removed from the working area the safety distance. Task swept and garbage picked. Working at the heights, we'll have our guardrail set up around the perimeter."

Cory Stevenson: "Uh, yeah, it's just the torching the wood is a little concerning, but you guys might need to change that to meet protocols."

In summary, the key risks identified are:
- Coordinating with multiple other trades on site and ensuring safety zones around lifting equipment 
- Torch work on wood decks poses a fire safety risk
- Working at heights
- Presence of combustible products

To mitigate these risks, they plan to:
- Remove combustibles from the work area 
- Sweep the area and pick up garbage
- Set up guardrails around the perimeter for fall protection
- Potentially change torching protocols on wood to meet safety requirements

The discussion seems to cover the major risks well, though more specifics could be provided on exactly how they will coordinate with other trades and what the revised torching protocols might be.
