Answer:
According to the discussion, this is Flynn's first project with the customer Grayback Construction. Frank Jonathan stated:

"Frank Jonathan - 24:49 
I see in the work we've contact persons.

KEL-WoodLake-BR(10)(VC) - 24:54
We've got Brian Rich who is the project manager for Grayback. We've got Earl Faraguna who is the construction manager and Bob McAllister who is the superintendent. So this is the main context for us.

...

Frank Jonathan - 24:49  
I haven't worked either. It's our first project with them."

So in summary, the customer is Grayback Construction, and Flynn has not worked with them before - this is their first project together. The main contacts at Grayback are Brian Rich (Project Manager), Earl Faraguna (Construction Manager), and Bob McAllister (Superintendent).
