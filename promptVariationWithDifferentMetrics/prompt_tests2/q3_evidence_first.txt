Answer:
Here are the relevant quotes about the project construction schedule for Flynn's scope of work:

Frank Jonathan: "The start roofing is scheduled for 13th of October 2025. And the project is scheduled for 128 crew with total crew."

KEL-WoodLake-BR(10)(VC): "My question is, with all the multi-scope projects, The way I counted for multiple mobilization and demobilization because we probably will be asked to come and do some pre-stripping then come back later on field as of any of those."

Frank Jonathan: "Right, so whatever is on been included for and anything above this."

In summary:
- Roofing work is scheduled to start on October 13, 2025
- The project is estimated to take 128 crew days total
- The estimate includes some allowance for multiple mobilizations/demobilizations to do pre-stripping work before the main roofing

Some key information that is missing or unclear:
- The expected completion date for Flynn's scope of work is not explicitly stated
- It's not fully clear how much allowance has been made for the pre-stripping mobilizations and if that will be sufficient
