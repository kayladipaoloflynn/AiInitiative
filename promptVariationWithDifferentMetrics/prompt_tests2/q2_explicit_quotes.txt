Answer:
Based on the discussion in the transcript, there are a few key risks associated with performing the work on this project:

1. Working around other trades and coordinating access:

KEL-WoodLake-BR(10)(VC): "So definitely Kevin and Cory, there will be a situation with multiple trades in our way. We'll have to coordinate leverage and making sure we've got the safety zone set up around all lifting equipment as soon as the perimeter of our work."

2. Safety risks from working at heights and with combustible products:

KEL-WoodLake-BR(10)(VC): "the risk, working at heights, combustible products, place to minimize this risk?"

Frank Jonathan: "to add that, I you're working on wood deck lot of torch, so safety to be watched out for."

3. Potential weather impacts and need for cold weather application procedures: 

KEL-WoodLake-BR(10)(VC): "So as we will be starting this project in October, we'll be probably running into late, you know, late or in the winter and proceeding through the winter with that. So we'll definitely have some limitations with the With the cap stripping installation, like the cut-off is zero degree, I'll have to make sure that the customer aware of that. We'll have to use a winter rated product, so winter rated primers for the SOPRA VAP."
