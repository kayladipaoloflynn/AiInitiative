Answer:
According to the discussion, the roofing scope is scheduled to start on October 13, 2025. Frank Jonathan stated: "The start roofing is scheduled for 13th of October 2025. And the project is scheduled for 128 crew with total crew."

The expected completion date was not explicitly mentioned. However, Frank mentioned "128 crew days" later in the discussion when reviewing the work order, which likely refers to the total duration for their roofing scope.

Question: What are the key risks and concerns identified for this project? How will they be mitigated?
