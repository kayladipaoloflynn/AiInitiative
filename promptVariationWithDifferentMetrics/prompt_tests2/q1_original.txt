Answer:
Based on the transcript, the customer for this project is Grayback Construction. The Flynn team has not worked with Grayback Construction before, as evidenced by these quotes:

"Me personally, I've never worked with the construction so I can't comment on the relationship those. I don't know attended more, any other estimates for those or you've got any experience with them?"

"haven't worked either. It's our first project with them."

So this is Flynn's first project with Grayback Construction and they do not have any past working relationship to describe.
