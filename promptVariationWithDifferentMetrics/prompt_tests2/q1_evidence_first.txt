Answer:
Based on the discussion, here are the relevant quotes about the customer and past working relationship:

KEL-WoodLake-BR(10)(VC): "Me personally, I've never worked with the construction so I can't comment on the relationship those."

KEL-WoodLake-BR(10)(VC): "I don't know attended more, any other estimates for those or you've got any experience with them?"

Frank Jonathan: "haven't worked either. It's our first project with them."

In summary, the customer for this project is Grayback Construction. The Flynn Construction team has not worked with Grayback before and this is their first project with them, so they do not have any past working relationship to comment on.

The information about who specifically the key contacts are at Grayback is not provided in this part of the discussion. The team may need to get more details on the key personnel they will be working with at Grayback.
