Answer:
According to the transcript, this is Flynn's first project with the customer Grayback Construction. There is no past working relationship to describe.

Frank Jonathan: "It's our first project with them."

KEL-WoodLake-BR(10)(VC): "Me personally, I've never worked with the construction so I can't comment on the relationship those. I don't know attended more, any other estimates for those or you've got any experience with them?"
Frank Jonathan: "haven't worked either. It's our first project with them."
