Q: Who is the customer for this project and describe our past working  relationship, if any?
A: Based on the discussion in the transcript, the customer for this project is Grayback Construction. The Flynn team has not worked with Grayback Construction before, so they do not have any past working relationship or experience with this customer.

As Dariusz from Flynn stated:
"Me personally, I've never worked with the construction so I can't comment on the relationship those. I don't know attended more, any other estimates for those or you've got any experience with them?"

To which Frank responded: 
"haven't worked either. It's our first project with them."

================================================================================

Q: Are there any concerns to note about the customer before proceeding?
A: Based on the transcript, there are no major concerns noted about the customer Grayback Construction before proceeding. A few key points:

1. Frank Jonathan mentioned "It's our first project with them", indicating they have not worked with Grayback Construction before and don't have direct experience to draw from.

2. KEL-WoodLake-BR(10)(VC) stated "Me personally, I've never worked with the construction so I can't comment on the relationship those. I don't know attended more, any other estimates for those or you've got any experience with them?" This further confirms it is their first project with this customer.

In summary, while no specific concerns are raised, it is noted that this is their first project working with Grayback Construction, so they don't have a prior working relationship or experience to reference. But no red flags about the customer are mentioned that would prevent them from proceeding.

================================================================================

Q: What is the project construction schedule (start and expected completion) for our scope?
A: Based on the transcript, the project construction schedule for Flynn's roofing scope is as follows:

"The start roofing is scheduled for 13th of October 2025. And the project is scheduled for 128 crew with total crew."

So roofing is scheduled to start on October 13, 2025 and is estimated to take 128 crew days with their total crew to complete.

================================================================================

Q: Are there any materials estimated for that require extended lead times for ordering/delivery?
A: Based on the discussion in the transcript, there are a couple items that may require extended lead times:

1. The tapered insulation package will likely need 3-4 weeks lead time. As Frank Jonathan mentioned, "From what I the taper package probably will need three to four weeks."

2. Most of the other materials seem to be standard stock items that should not require long lead times. As Kel-WoodLake stated, "Everything is standard, standard stock, so I don't think there are any times."

So in summary, the tapered insulation is the main item identified as potentially needing an extended 3-4 week lead time, while the rest of the materials are expected to be readily available standard stock items.

================================================================================

Q: Have any alternate materials been included in the scope of work or specification?
A: Based on the transcript, there are a couple of items that may require alternate materials or need to be confirmed with the customer before starting:

1. Roof anchors were shown as a bidding item and need to be confirmed. As Frank mentions, "Apart from that, I don't see any other confirmed as everything letter."

2. There is a discussion about potentially using SOPRA-INFLAM 180 base and cap instead of the SOPRA-INFLAM 250 FR cap that was bid, as a cost savings on the inverted roof assembly. Dariusz says "So what I'm saying here is because the deck is gonna get covered with the drainage mat and insulation, There is no express membrane, we can basically go base on base and that will be cost saving."

So in summary, roof anchors need to be confirmed, and there is a potential alternate material (SOPRA-INFLAM 180 instead of 250 FR) that could provide cost savings but needs to be approved by the customer first.

================================================================================

Q: Do we need to bring these alternates to the attention of the client/customer before starting?
A: Based on the transcript, there are two items that need to be brought to the attention of the client/customer before starting:

1. Roof anchors. As Frank Jonathan stated, "Apart from that, I don't see any other alternates to be confirmed as everything is as per the spec letter. Roof anchors were shown as a bidding note to be confirmed."

2. Using base ply on base ply (SOPRA-INFLAM 180) on the concrete deck instead of using fire-rated cap sheet, as a potential cost savings. KEL-WoodLake-BR(10)(VC) said "Also we will have to confirm with the customer if they are okay with us using the 180 base on base on the concrete deck, if they're okay with that since this is not a combustible deck."

So in summary, the roof anchors and the potential change to base ply on the concrete deck instead of fire-rated cap sheet are two alternate items that should be confirmed with the client before proceeding.

================================================================================

Q: Do you feel that there are any underlying risks associated with performing  our work on this project and do we need to bring anything to the attention of the customer before starting?
A: Based on the discussion in the meeting transcript, there are a few potential risks and items that should be brought to the customer's attention before starting work on this project:

1. Working around multiple trades and coordinating logistics. As Kevin mentioned, "there will be a situation with multiple trades in our way. We'll have to coordinate leverage and making sure we've got the safety zone set up around all lifting equipment as soon as the perimeter of our work."

2. Safety risks from working at heights and with combustible products when torch applying the roof. As stated in the meeting, "Working at the heights, we'll have our guardrail set up around the perimeter" and "all the combustibles will have to be removed from the working area the safety distance. Task swept and garbage picked."

3. The project is scheduled to start in October and continue into the winter months. This means cold weather application procedures may be needed. Dariusz noted "We'll definitely have some limitations with the With the cap stripping installation, like the cut-off is zero degree, I'll have to make sure that the customer aware of that. We'll have to use a winter rated product, so winter rated primers for the SOPRA VAP."

4. Cory also expressed some concern about torching directly on the wood deck, stating "Uh, yeah, it's just the torching the wood is a little concerning, but you guys might need to change that to meet protocols."

================================================================================

Q: Depending on the Risk, i.e. working at heights, combustible products, etc., what precautions are being put in place to minimize these risks?
A: Based on the transcript, the following precautions are being put in place to minimize risks like working at heights and with combustible products:

1. To address working at heights, guardrails will be set up around the perimeter of the work area. As Dariusz states, "Working at the heights, we'll have our guardrail set up around the perimeter."

2. For the risk of working with combustible products and torches on the wood deck, combustible materials will be removed from the work area to a safe distance. The area will also be swept clean of debris. Dariusz mentions "Picture framing current, all the penetrations, picture framing current, all parameters, all the combustibles will have to be removed from the working area the safety distance. Task swept and garbage picked."

So in summary, guardrails will be used to mitigate fall risks from heights, and combustible materials will be cleared from the torching work areas on the wood deck to reduce fire hazards. The team is aware of these key risks and is planning appropriate safety precautions.

================================================================================

Q: What equipment has been estimated for and what amount has been carried  for each?
A: According to the transcript, the following equipment has been estimated for the project:

1. Crane usage - "we've carried for 250 dollars an hour And total allowance of both inverted and, let me just combine this one second, 20 hours here on inverted, 46 hours overall, has been allowed for."

2. There was no mention of any other specific equipment that was estimated for. The transcript notes "Everything is standard, standard stock, so I don't think there are any times" in response to a question about lead times for ordering and delivery of materials.

================================================================================

Q: Has the estimating team done a complete overview of the project but not  limited to, drawings, specifications, and estimate?
A: Yes, based on the transcript it appears the estimating team has done a complete overview of the project scope, drawings, specifications and estimate.

Evidence from the transcript:

Frank Jonathan says "Yes, it's there on your folder." when asked if the estimating team provided a complete global takeoff to the construction team.

KEL-WoodLake-BR(10)(VC) states "At this point, there is no more questions. We have very little time review this, but everything seems clear." when asked if the construction team has a 100% clear idea of the complete project scope.

================================================================================

Q: Did estimating provide to the construction team a complete Bluebeam take -off with highlighted drawings indicating our scope of work?
A: Yes, according to the transcript, the estimating team did provide a complete Bluebeam take-off with highlighted drawings indicating the scope of work to the construction team.

Frank Jonathan stated: "Yes, it's there on your folder."

Dariusz from the construction team responded: "Yeah, I like easy for guys for our performance to spot, so thank you for that."

================================================================================

Q: Does the construction team have a 100% clear idea of what our complete scope is?
A: Yes, based on the discussion in the handover meeting, the construction team has a clear idea of the complete project scope at this point. This is evidenced by two key quotes:

"At this point, there is no more questions. We have very little time review this, but everything seems clear."

When asked directly "Does the construction team have a 100% clear idea of what our complete scope is?", the response was "yes. At this point, there is no more questions."

So while they may have additional questions as the project gets closer, the construction team confirmed they have a clear understanding of the full scope based on the information provided in the handover meeting.

================================================================================

Q: What input or suggestions did the Foreman have in regard to the installation of our work?
A: Based on the transcript, the Foreman Kevin Trahan provided the following input regarding the installation:

"Um, no, it seems like it should be fairly straightforward. do like the color coding as That should help a lot to know uh, yeah."

He suggested that the color coding on the plans should help make the installation fairly straightforward to understand and execute.

================================================================================

Q: Have the Project Payroll Attributes been reviewed and confirmed to be correct?
A: Yes, based on the discussion in the handover meeting, the Project Payroll Attributes have been reviewed and confirmed to be correct.

The transcript states:

"KEL-WoodLake-BR(10)(VC) - 33:11
review or have project payroll attributes will be confirmed I say yes.

KEL-WoodLake-BR(10)(VC) - 33:19
It appears be correct."

So in response to the question "Does the construction team have a 100% clear idea of what our complete scope is?", KEL-WoodLake-BR(10)(VC) confirms that the Project Payroll Attributes have been reviewed and appear to be correct.

================================================================================

Q: Do we have a design system letter from the manufacturer that meets the warranty/code requirements and provides the adhesive/fastening pattern?
A: Based on the transcript, it seems we do have a design letter from the manufacturer that meets warranty/code requirements and provides the adhesive/fastening pattern. This is evidenced by two key pieces of information:

1. When asked directly "Did we obtain that design letter?", Frank Jonathan responds "Yes."

2. Later in the transcript, Frank states "So pretty much got to do with the design letter at the time the wind calculated through the calculator." This suggests they have a design letter that was used along with wind uplift calculations.

So while the full details are not provided, it appears a manufacturer design letter meeting the necessary requirements has been obtained for this project.

================================================================================

Q: Does this project require any cold weather application procedures as recommended by the manufacturer? If yes, what are they?
A: Yes, this project will likely require cold weather application procedures as recommended by the manufacturer. According to the transcript:

"So as we will be starting this project in October, we'll be probably running into late, you know, late or in the winter and proceeding through the winter with that. So we'll definitely have some limitations with the With the cap stripping installation, like the cut-off is zero degree, I'll have to make sure that the customer aware of that. We'll have to use a winter rated product, so winter rated primers for the SOPRA VAP. This we can install to minus 10, which is good."

The specific cold weather procedures mentioned are:

1. There will be limitations with cap stripping installation, with a cut-off temperature of zero degrees. The customer will need to be made aware of this.

2. They will need to use winter rated products, such as winter rated primers for the SOPRA VAP, which can be installed down to minus 10 degrees.

================================================================================

Q: Has Contract been reviewed internally?
A: Yes, the contract has been reviewed internally according to the transcript. Specifically, it states:

"KEL-WoodLake-BR(10)(VC) - 36:00
that's been reviewed, but our branch manager development manager as long as me for the details."

This indicates that the contract was reviewed by the branch manager, development manager, and the speaker (likely Dariusz based on context).

================================================================================

Q: Are there any contractual risks to note?
A: Based on the transcript, there are a couple potential contractual risks to note:

1. The project does not have a copy of the prime contract yet. As stated in the transcript: "We don't have the copy of prime contract, I believe, yet. That will be requested." Not having the prime contract could pose a risk if there are any terms or requirements that impact Flynn's work.

2. It's unclear if prompt payment rules apply to this project. The transcript mentions "We don't believe we have the prompt payment rules yet" in regards to payment terms and how long it will take invoices to be paid. Lack of prompt payment protections could be a financial risk.

In summary, the key contractual risks seem to be not yet having a copy of the prime contract to review, and uncertainty around prompt payment rules and invoice payment timelines. Obtaining the prime contract and clarifying the payment terms will be important to mitigate potential risks.

================================================================================

Q: If we are a Subcontractor, do we have a copy of the Prime Contract? If not,  request a copy.
A: Based on the discussion in the transcript, it appears that Flynn does not have a copy of the prime contract yet. This is evident from the following exchange:

"If you are the subcontractor, do you have the copy of prime contract? 
If not, request the copy of the prime contract. 
don't have the copy of prime contract, I believe, yet. 
That will be requested."

So as a subcontractor, Flynn does not currently have the prime contract and will need to request a copy of it from the general contractor or owner.

================================================================================

Q: What is the date of the Prime Contract?
A: The transcript does not mention the date of the Prime Contract. The participants note that they do not have a copy of the Prime Contract yet, but will request it.

For example, the transcript states:
"Do we have the copy of prime contract? I don't believe we have the copy of prime contract, I believe, yet. That will be requested."

However, no specific date for the Prime Contract is provided in the discussion.

================================================================================

Q: Do we know if "prompt payment" rules apply under the provincial construction legislation (given the date of the Prime Contract)?
A: Based on the transcript, it does not appear that the prompt payment rules under provincial construction legislation are known or confirmed yet for this project. A few key pieces of evidence:

"We don't have the – I don't believe we have the prompt payment rules yet, but it, will take for the invoice to be paid and then the payment terms."

"Does the contract specify requirements proper invoice? What information must be included in our invoice? What documentation information must be submitted with invoice? That's applicable, I believe, at this yet."

The team seems uncertain about the applicability of prompt payment rules and invoice requirements at this stage, implying they still need to review the prime contract in more detail to determine this.

================================================================================

Q: What are the payment terms?
A: Based on the transcript, the payment terms are not yet known. A few key points:

- They do not believe they have the prompt payment rules yet. As stated: "We don't have the – I don't believe we have the prompt payment rules yet, but it, will take for the invoice to be paid and then the payment terms."

- It's unclear what information must be included in the invoice or what documentation needs to be submitted with the invoice. 

- They are unsure if a draft invoice needs to be submitted before the actual invoice.

So in summary, the exact payment terms and invoice requirements still need to be determined and confirmed with the customer. The transcript does not provide the specific payment terms that were agreed to.

================================================================================

Q: How long will it take for our invoice to be paid?
A: Based on the discussion in the transcript, it seems the payment terms and how long it will take for invoices to be paid is not yet known. Specifically, Dariusz states:

"We don't have the – I don't believe we have the prompt payment rules yet, but it, will take for the invoice to be paid and then the payment terms."

He also mentions they do not have a copy of the prime contract yet, which would likely contain the payment terms and timeline details. The team plans to request a copy of the prime contract to get more information on this.

================================================================================

Q: Does the contract specify requirements for a proper invoice?
A: Based on the transcript, it is unclear if the contract specifies requirements for a proper invoice. The relevant discussion is:

"Does the contract specify requirements proper invoice? 

KEL-WoodLake-BR(10)(VC) - 36:29
What information must be included in our invoice? 
What documentation information must be submitted with invoice?

So, definitely the progress report and the schedule of values will accompany each of the invoices."

While it mentions that progress reports and a schedule of values will accompany the invoices, there is no definitive statement on whether the contract itself specifies invoice requirements. More information would be needed from the contract to determine this.

================================================================================

Q: What information must be included in our invoice?
A: Based on the discussion in the transcript, the following information must be included in the invoice:

"definitely the progress report and the schedule of values will accompany each of the invoices."

The transcript does not provide any other specific details on what must be included in the invoice beyond the progress report and schedule of values.

================================================================================

Q: What documentation/information must be submitted with each invoice?
A: Based on the discussion in the transcript, the following documentation/information must be submitted with each invoice:

"So, definitely the progress report and the schedule of values will accompany each of the invoices."

The key points are:
1. A progress report must be submitted with each invoice
2. A schedule of values must be submitted with each invoice

================================================================================

Q: Do we need to submit a "draft invoice" before we submit our actual invoice? If so, when does the "draft invoice" need to be submitted?
A: Based on the transcript, it does not appear that submitting a draft invoice is applicable at this point. The relevant excerpt is:

"Do we need to submit a draft invoice before we submit our action invoice?  
If so, draft need to be submitted?  
What information must be provided in the draft invoice?  
That's applicable, I believe, at this yet."

The speaker states "That's applicable, I believe, at this yet", which suggests submitting a draft invoice is not required for this project currently.

================================================================================

Q: What information must be provided in the "draft invoice"?
A: Based on the discussion in the transcript, it appears that submitting a draft invoice is not applicable for this project at this point. Specifically, the transcript states:

"Do we need to submit a draft invoice before we submit our action invoice? 
If so, draft need to be submitted? 
What information must be provided in the draft invoice? 
That's applicable, I believe, at this yet."

So the participants conclude that providing a draft invoice is not currently a requirement for the Dillworth phase 1 project.

================================================================================

Q: Is a Performance Bond Required for this Project?
A: Based on the discussion in the transcript, a performance bond is not required for this project. Specifically, when asked "is the performing bond requirement required project?", the response was:

"Do we have bonding for this?  
No, we don't bonding.  
No bonding?  
No bonding.  
Okay."

So it is clearly stated that no bonding or performance bond is required for the Dillworth phase 1 project.

================================================================================
