QUESTION 3: What is the project construction schedule (start and expected completion) for our scope?

ANSWER:
1. Direct quotes from the transcript  
   - “The start roofing is scheduled for 13th of October 2025.” (KEL-WoodLake-BR(10)(VC), timestamp 25:20)  
   - “And the project is scheduled for 128 crew with total crew.” (Multiple speakers, immediately following the start-date comment at 25:20)  

2. Expert interpretation  
   • The team has committed to mobilize and begin all roofing activities on October 13, 2025.  
   • The “128 crew” reference is best understood in context as 128 crew-days allocated to execute our roofing scope. In other words, the estimate provides for one crew working 128 days (or equivalently, multiple crews whose combined labor hours total 128 crew-days).  

3. Professional summary  
   Based on the handover discussion, our roofing package for Dillworth Phase 1 is slated to start on October 13, 2025.  The estimating team has budgeted 128 crew-days for the full scope—this is the basis for our planning and staffing.  With a single six-man crew (as assumed elsewhere in the estimate), that equates to roughly 21 standard eight-hour workweeks of active roofing work.  Accordingly, barring weather or coordination delays, we can reasonably expect to complete our portion of the work in the first quarter of 2026.
