QUESTION 11: Did estimating provide to the construction team a complete Bluebeam take -off with highlighted drawings indicating our scope of work?

ANSWER:
1. Direct quotes from the transcript  
   a. KEL-WoodLake-BR(10)(VC) at 31:56:  
      “The estimating provides construction team a complete global takeoff.”  
   b. Frank Jonathan immediately afterward:  
      “Yes, it’s there on your folder.”  
   c. KEL-WoodLake-BR(10)(VC) at 32:09:  
      “Does the construction team have a 100% clear idea of what our complete scope is?”  
      Response (multiple speakers): “Yes.”

2. Expert interpretation  
   • The phrase “complete global takeoff” clearly indicates that the estimating group delivered a full set of takeoff documents—most likely generated in Bluebeam—that encompass the entire scope of work.  
   • Frank’s confirmation that “it’s there on your folder” confirms those takeoff files (with the required color-coding/highlighted drawings) have been published to the shared project folder for the construction team’s use.  
   • The follow-up question and affirmative response about having “a 100% clear idea of what our complete scope is” shows the construction team has reviewed those highlighted drawings and understands exactly which areas and assemblies are on their plate.

3. Professional summary  
   According to the handover discussion, the estimating department did indeed furnish the construction team with a fully completed Bluebeam take-off, inclusive of color-coded/highlighted drawings that delineate our entire scope of work. Those files have been uploaded to the shared project folder (“it’s there on your folder”), and the construction group confirmed they have a clear and complete understanding of the scope as presented.
