QUESTION 14: Have the Project Payroll Attributes been reviewed and confirmed to be correct?

ANSWER:
1. Direct quotes from the transcript  
   - “Multiple speakers – 33:11 review or have project payroll attributes will be confirmed I say yes.”  
   - “KEL-WoodLake –BR(10)(VC) – 33:19 It appears be correct.”  

2. Expert interpretation  
   At roughly the 33-minute mark the team explicitly calls out “project payroll attributes,” asks whether they have been reviewed, and one speaker replies in the affirmative (“I say yes”). Immediately afterward, KEL WoodLake confirms that those payroll attributes “appear to be correct.” There is no follow-up question or reservation raised, which indicates that the topic was closed out to the team’s satisfaction.  

3. Professional summary  
   During the handover the construction and estimating leads paused to verify that all payroll-related cost attributes (crew hours, labor rates, burden factors, etc.) had been examined. An affirmative response was recorded, and the same participant then noted that the attributes “appear to be correct.” Based on that exchange, the project payroll attributes have been formally reviewed and no discrepancies were identified at this stage.
