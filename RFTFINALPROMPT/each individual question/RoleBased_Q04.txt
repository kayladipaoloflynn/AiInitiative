QUESTION 4: Are there any materials estimated for that require extended lead times for ordering/delivery?

ANSWER:
1. Direct quotes from the transcript  
   • “Everything is standard, standard stock, so I don’t think there are any lead times.” (KEL-WoodLake-BR(10)(VC), 26:43–26:49)  
   • “From what I recall the taper package probably will need three to four weeks.” (Frank Jonathan, 26:54–27:01)  

2. Expert interpretation  
   – The project’s bulk roofing materials (SOPRA membranes, cap sheets, insulation boards, traffic apps, adhesives, etc.) are all standard, off-the-shelf products and carry no special ordering delays.  
   – The only item flagged with a non-standard lead time is the tapered insulation package (the “taper package”). Because tapered insulation is custom-cut to match the roof slope and drainage requirements, it typically requires a 3- to 4-week production and delivery window.  

3. Professional summary  
   During the handover meeting, the team confirmed that nearly all specified roofing materials are standard stock and can be procured without extended waits. The sole exception is the tapered insulation (the “taper package”), which, due to its bespoke cutting and configuration, carries an anticipated lead time of three to four weeks. No other items were identified as having special ordering or delivery constraints.
