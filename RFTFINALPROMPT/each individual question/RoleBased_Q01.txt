QUESTION 1: Who is the customer for this project and describe our past working  relationship, if any?

ANSWER:
1. Direct quotes from the transcript  
   – KEL-WoodLake: “So who is the customer for the project describe our past working any, are they any concern to not before proceedings?”  
   – Frank Jonathan: “Me personally, I’ve never worked with the construction so I can’t comment on the relationship those. … Haven’t worked either. It’s our first project with them.”  
   – KEL-WoodLake: “We’ve got Brian Rich who is the project manager for Grayback. We’ve got Earl Faraguna who is the construction manager and Bob McAllister who is the superintendent. So this is the main context for us.”

2. Expert interpretation  
   – The “customer” in this handover is the general contractor, Grayback Construction.  “Grayback” is the entity that engaged our roofing scope, with three primary Grayback contacts identified: Brian Rich (Project Manager), Earl Faraguna (Construction Manager) and Bob McAllister (Superintendent).  
   – Based on both Frank’s and the team’s admission that “it’s our first project with them” and that neither Frank nor any of the estimators or foremen have “ever worked with” this client before, there is no existing working relationship or established rapport.  

3. Professional summary  
   The project’s customer is Grayback Construction, represented on‐site by Brian Rich, Earl Faraguna and Bob McAllister.  This will be our company’s inaugural roofing contract with Grayback—no prior joint projects exist.  As such, we should anticipate a brief qualifying period during mobilization to align on Grayback’s protocols, communication style and documentation requirements.  Early engagement with the named Grayback contacts will be critical to mitigate any startup friction and to build the foundation for a successful working relationship.
