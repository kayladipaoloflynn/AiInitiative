QUESTION 17: Has Contract been reviewed internally?

ANSWER:
1. Direct quotes from the transcript  
   • KEL-WoodLake-BR(10)(VC) at 35:23: “contract been reviewed internally?”  
   • Frank Jonathan/KEL (unattributed immediately afterwards): “that’s been reviewed, but our branch manager development manager as long as me for the details.”  
   • KEL-WoodLake-BR(10)(VC) at 35:30: “If you are the subcontractor, do you have the copy of prime contract? … don’t have the copy of prime contract, I believe, yet. That will be requested.”

2. Expert interpretation  
   • The team confirms that an internal review of the contract documents has been completed by the branch manager, the development manager and the project team lead (“that’s been reviewed…”).  
   • However, as a subcontractor to the prime, they do not yet possess the prime contract itself and recognize that they must formally request it before mobilization.  
   • Related commercial items—prompt payment rules, invoice requirements, bonding obligations—are still to be clarified once the prime contract is on file.

3. Professional summary  
   Yes, the contract has undergone an internal review by the branch manager, development manager and project team, so the team is satisfied that they have identified the substantive scope and obligations from the documents at hand.  As a next step, because they are acting as a subcontractor, they do not yet have the actual prime contract and must request a copy to confirm prompt-payment provisions, invoicing requirements and any bonding or registration obligations before work begins.
