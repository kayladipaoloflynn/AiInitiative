QUESTION 22: What are the payment terms?

ANSWER:
1. Direct quotes from the transcript that relate to payment terms  
   • KEL-WoodLake-BR(10)(VC) (00:36:00):  
     “Are the payment terms and how long it will take for our invoice to be paid?  
     We don’t have the – I don’t believe we have the prompt payment rules yet, but it, will take for the invoice to be paid and then the payment terms.”  
   • KEL-WoodLake-BR(10)(VC) (00:36:26):  
     “Does the contract specify requirements proper invoice? What information must be included in our invoice? What documentation information must be submitted with invoice? So, definitely the progress report and the schedule of values will accompany each of the invoices.”  

2. Expert interpretation  
   – No definitive payment schedule (e.g. Net 30, Net 45) was established in this meeting.  
   – The team acknowledged they have not yet reviewed or obtained the prime contract, which would contain the formal “payment terms” and any governing prompt-payment legislation.  
   – It was agreed that each invoice will be supported by a progress report and a schedule of values, per standard construction invoicing practice, but the timing and trigger points for payment remain to be confirmed.  

3. Professional summary  
   During the handover discussion, the project team identified that the specific payment terms have not yet been determined because they do not yet have the prime contract or provincial prompt-payment rules in hand. To move forward:  
   • The construction team will request and review the prime contract to confirm invoice submittal requirements and the formal payment schedule (for example, Net X days, holdback percentages, prompt-payment deadlines).  
   • In the interim, they intend to prepare their invoices in accordance with best practices—attaching progress reports and a detailed schedule of values—to ensure all required documentation accompanies each billing.  
   • Final payment terms (timing, holdbacks, interest on late payment) will be defined once the prime contract and applicable prompt-payment legislation are reviewed and incorporated into their billing procedures.
