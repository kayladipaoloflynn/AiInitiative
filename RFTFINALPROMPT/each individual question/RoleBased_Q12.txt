QUESTION 12: Does the construction team have a 100% clear idea of what our complete scope is?

ANSWER:
1. Direct quotes from the transcript that answer the question  
   • KEL-WoodLake-BR(10)(VC) (32:09): “Does the construction team have a 100% clear idea of what our complete scope is?”  
   • Multiple speakers (immediately following): “Yes.”  
   • KEL-WoodLake-BR(10)(VC) (32:11): “At this point, there is no more questions. We have very little time to review this, but everything seems clear.”

2. Expert interpretation of this information  
   – At the formal scope-review checkpoint, the field and estimating team unanimously confirmed they understand “100%” of the work outlined in the handover.  
   – Their affirmation follows a detailed walkthrough of assemblies, quantities, equipment allowances (crane hours, mobilization), special conditions (winter-rated primers, fire-rated cap sheets), and administrative items (design letters, wind uplift calcs, invoice requirements).  
   – While the team agreed the high-level scope is clear, the transcript also surfaces a handful of “to-confirm” items—prime‐contract terms, payment rules, final material approvals, and certain coordination (roof anchors, scaffolding, membrane up-and-over details). Those will need follow-up but do not, in their view, obscure the overall contractual scope.

3. Professional summary  
   During the handoff the construction group explicitly affirmed they have a “100% clear idea” of their complete roofing scope, confirming no outstanding questions at the close of the meeting. They have reviewed all major assemblies, logistics allowances, safety and sequencing risks, and administrative deliverables. A few minor items were flagged for ongoing confirmation (e.g., winter install limits, prime‐contract access, final anchor and payment‐term sign-off), but none were judged to affect the overall scope definition.
