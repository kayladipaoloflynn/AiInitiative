QUESTION 20: What is the date of the Prime Contract?

ANSWER:
1. Direct quotes from the transcript  
   - KEL-WoodLake-BR(10)(VC) (34:53–35:06):  
     “contract been reviewed internally? … If you are the subcontractor, do you have the copy of prime contract?  
      If not, request the copy of the prime contract.  
      don’t have the copy of prime contract, I believe, yet. That will be requested.”  

2. Expert interpretation  
   - During the handover meeting, the team specifically noted that the subcontractor did not yet possess the Prime Contract and that they would need to request it. Because the document was not on hand, no reference was made to its date.  

3. Professional summary  
   - The transcript contains no reference to the date of the Prime Contract. In fact, the participants acknowledge that they have not yet received a copy of the Prime Contract and must formally request it before they can review its contents—including its effective date. Without the Prime Contract in hand, the date remains undetermined at this stage of the handover.
