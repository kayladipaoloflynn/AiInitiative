Based on the discussion, here are the relevant quotes about the customer and past working relationship:

KEL-WoodLake-BR(10)(VC): "Who is the customer for the project describe our past working any, are they any concern to not before proceedings?"

Frank Jonathan: "Me personally, I've never worked with the construction so I can't comment on the relationship those. I don't know attended more, any other estimates for those or you've got any experience with them?"

KEL-WoodLake-BR(10)(VC): "haven't worked either. It's our first project with them."

KEL-WoodLake-BR(10)(VC): "We've got Brian Rich who is the project manager for Grayback. We've got Earl Faraguna who is the construction manager and Bob McAllister who is the superintendent. So this is the main context for us."

In summary:
- The customer for the project is Grayback Construction
- This is Flynn's first project with Grayback, so they have no past working relationship
- The main contacts at Grayback are Brian Rich (project manager), Earl Faraguna (construction manager), and Bob McAllister (superintendent)

The discussion does not provide any additional details on Grayback as a company or customer. It's unclear if anyone has other knowledge or opinions about working with them.
