Answer:
Based on the transcript, the customer for this project is Grayback Construction. The Flynn team has not worked with Grayback Construction before, as evidenced by these quotes:

"Me personally, I've never worked with the construction so I can't comment on the relationship those. I don't know attended more, any other estimates for those or you've got any experience with them?"

"haven't worked either. It's our first project with them."

So in summary, Grayback Construction is a new customer for Flynn and they do not have any past working relationship to draw upon for this project.
