Answer:
Based on the discussion, there are a few key risks identified with performing the roofing work on this project:

1. Multiple trades working in the same areas, requiring coordination and safety zones around lifting equipment and work perimeters. As Kevin stated: "there will be a situation with multiple trades in our way. We'll have to coordinate leverage and making sure we've got the safety zone set up around all lifting equipment as soon as the perimeter of our work."

2. Working on wood decks with a lot of torch-applied materials poses a fire safety risk. As Frank noted: "to add that, I think you're working on wood deck with a lot of torch, so safety to be watched out for."

3. Working at heights will require proper fall protection and guardrails around roof perimeters. 

4. Cold weather installation may be required starting in October and going into winter. This will necessitate using winter-rated products and primers, and may limit installation of cap stripping which has a cut-off temperature of 0°C. As Dariusz mentioned: "we'll definitely have some limitations with the cap stripping installation, like the cut-off is zero degree, we'll have to make sure that the customer is aware of that."

The team acknowledged these risks will need to be closely monitored and mitigated as the project gets underway. Seeing actual site conditions will be important to fully assess the risks.
