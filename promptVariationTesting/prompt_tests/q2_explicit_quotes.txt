Answer:
Based on the discussion in the transcript, there are a few key risks associated with performing the work on this project:

1. Multiple trades working in the same area, requiring coordination. As Dariusz mentioned:

KEL-WoodLake-BR(10)(VC): "So definitely Kevin and Cory, there will be a situation with multiple trades in our way. We'll have to coordinate leverage and making sure we've got the safety zone set up around all lifting equipment as soon as the perimeter of our work."

2. Working at heights, requiring proper safety precautions like guardrails. Dariusz stated: 

KEL-WoodLake-BR(10)(VC): "Working at the heights, we'll have our guardrail set up around the perimeter."

3. Using combustible torch-applied products on a wood deck, requiring extra safety measures. As Frank noted:

Frank Jonathan: "to add that, I you're working on wood deck lot of torch, so safety to be watched out for."

4. Potentially working in cold winter conditions, which may require using special cold weather application procedures and products. Dariusz explained:

KEL-WoodLake-BR(10)(VC): "So as we will be starting this project in October, we'll be probably running into late, you know, late or in the winter and proceeding through the winter with that. So we'll definitely have some limitations with the With the cap stripping installation, like the cut-off is zero degree, I'll have to make sure that the customer aware of that. We'll have to use a winter rated product, so winter rated primers for the SOPRA VAP."
