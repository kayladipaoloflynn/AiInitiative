Answer:
Based on the transcript, there are a few key underlying risks associated with performing the work on this project:

1. There will likely be situations with multiple trades in the way that will require coordination. As Kevin mentions, "there will be a situation with multiple trades in our way. We'll have to coordinate leverage and making sure we've got the safety zone set up around all lifting equipment as soon as the perimeter of our work."

2. The work involves torching on a wood deck, so safety needs to be closely watched. As stated in the discussion, "to add that, I you're working on wood deck lot of torch, so safety to be watched out for."

3. The project involves working at heights, so proper safety precautions like guardrails need to be in place. Dariusz notes "Working at the heights, we'll have our guardrail set up around the perimeter."

4. The project timeline extends into late fall/winter, so cold weather application procedures may be required. Dariusz explains "as we will be starting this project in October, we'll be probably running into late, you know, late or in the winter and proceeding through the winter with that. So we'll definitely have some limitations with the With the cap stripping installation, like the cut-off is zero degree."
