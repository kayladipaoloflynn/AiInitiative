Answer:
Here are the relevant quotes about underlying risks on this project:

KEL-WoodLake-BR(10)(VC): "So definitely Kevin and Cory, there will be a situation with multiple trades in our way. We'll have to coordinate leverage and making sure we've got the safety zone set up around all lifting equipment as soon as the perimeter of our work."

Multiple speakers: "And to add that, I you're working on wood deck lot of torch, so safety to be watched out for."

KEL-WoodLake-BR(10)(VC): "the risk, working at heights, combustible products, place to minimize this risk? Picture framing current, all the penetrations, picture framing current, all parameters, all the combustibles will have to be removed from the working area the safety distance. Task swept and garbage picked. Working at the heights, we'll have our guardrail set up around the perimeter."

Cory Stevenson: "Uh, yeah, it's just the torching the wood is a little concerning, but you guys might need to change that to meet protocols."

In summary, the key risks identified are:
- Coordinating with multiple other trades on site and ensuring safety zones around lifting equipment 
- Torch work on wood decks poses a fire safety risk
- Working at heights requires safety precautions like guardrails
- Combustible materials need to be removed from the work area

Some information that is unclear or missing:
- The exact site conditions and layout are unknown until closer to the project start
- It's not specified if any changes will be made to the torching on wood to meet safety protocols
