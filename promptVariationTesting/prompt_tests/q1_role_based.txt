Answer:
Based on the discussion, it seems this is Flynn's first project with the customer Grayback Construction. A few key points:

- Dariusz stated: "Me personally, I've never worked with the construction so I can't comment on the relationship those."

- Frank said: "I haven't worked either. It's our first project with them."

The main contacts at Grayback Construction are:

- Brian Rich - Project Manager  
- Earl Faraguna - Construction Manager
- Bob McAllister - Superintendent

So in summary, Flynn does not have any past working relationship with Grayback Construction, as this appears to be the first project Flynn is doing with them. The team will need to establish a good working dynamic with the Grayback contacts.
