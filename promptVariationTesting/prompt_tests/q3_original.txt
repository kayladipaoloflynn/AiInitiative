Answer:
Based on the transcript, the project construction schedule for Flynn's roofing scope is as follows:

"The start roofing is scheduled for 13th of October 2025. And the project is scheduled for 128 crew with total crew."

So roofing is scheduled to start on October 13, 2025 and is estimated to take 128 crew days with their total crew to complete.
