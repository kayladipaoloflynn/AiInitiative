Answer:
DIRECT ANSWER: The main underlying risks associated with performing the work on this project are working at heights, using combustible products, and coordinating with multiple trades in the same work areas.

EVIDENCE:
KEL-WoodLake-BR(10)(VC): "So definitely Kevin and Cory, there will be a situation with multiple trades in our way. We'll have to coordinate leverage and making sure we've got the safety zone set up around all lifting equipment as soon as the perimeter of our work."
Multiple speakers: "And to add that, I you're working on wood deck lot of torch, so safety to be watched out for."

ADDITIONAL CONTEXT:
- The project involves torch-applied roofing on wood decks, which poses a fire safety risk.
- Work will be done at heights, requiring proper fall protection and guardrails.
- With multiple trades working in the same areas, coordination will be critical to avoid conflicts and maintain safe work zones.

MISSING INFO:
- The specific fall protection systems and protocols that will be used are not discussed in detail.
- There is no mention of fire watch procedures or other torch safety measures that will be implemented.
- More information on how trade coordination will be managed could be helpful.
