Answer:
KEL-WoodLake-BR(10)(VC): "Me personally, I've never worked with the construction so I can't comment on the relationship those. I don't know attended more, any other estimates for those or you've got any experience with them?"

Multiple speakers: "haven't worked either. It's our first project with them."

**Actionable Information:**
- This is the first project with the customer, so there is no past working relationship to reference.
- Ensure clear communication and establish a strong working relationship from the start.
