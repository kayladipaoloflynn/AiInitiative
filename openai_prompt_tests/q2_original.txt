Answer:
The underlying risks associated with performing work on this project include:

1. **Coordination with Multiple Trades**: There is a risk of interference with other trades on site, which requires careful coordination. As noted, "there will be a situation with multiple trades in our way. We'll have to coordinate leverage and making sure we've got the safety zone set up around all lifting equipment."

2. **Safety Concerns with Torch Work**: The use of torches on a wood deck poses a safety risk. It was mentioned, "you're working on wood deck lot of torch, so safety to be watched out for."

3. **Combustible Materials**: The presence of combustible materials requires precautions to minimize risks. The transcript states, "working at heights, combustible products, place to minimize this risk? Picture framing current, all the penetrations, picture framing current, all parameters, all the combustibles will have to be removed from the working area the safety distance."

4. **Weather Conditions**: The project timeline extending into winter presents challenges. It is noted, "we'll be probably running into late, you know, late or in the winter and proceeding through the winter with that."

These risks highlight the need for careful planning and safety measures to ensure the project's successful and safe execution.
