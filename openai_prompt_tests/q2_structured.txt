Answer:
1. DIRECT ANSWER: The underlying risks include coordinating with multiple trades, safety concerns with working at heights, and the use of combustible materials.

2. EVIDENCE: 
   - KEL-WoodLake -BR(10)(VC) mentioned, "there will be a situation with multiple trades in our way. We'll have to coordinate leverage and making sure we've got the safety zone set up around all lifting equipment."
   - KEL-WoodLake -BR(10)(VC) also noted, "working at heights, combustible products, place to minimize this risk?"
   - Multiple speakers added, "you're working on wood deck lot of torch, so safety to be watched out for."

3. ADDITIONAL CONTEXT: The project involves tasks that require careful management of safety protocols, especially due to the presence of other trades and the nature of materials being used. Ensuring proper safety zones and handling of combustible materials is crucial.

4. MISSING INFO: Specific strategies to mitigate these risks were not discussed in detail, nor were there any mentions of contingency plans in case of safety breaches.
