Answer:
The underlying risks associated with performing work on this project include:

1. **Coordination with Multiple Trades**: There will be multiple trades on site, requiring careful coordination to ensure safety and efficiency.

2. **Safety Concerns**: Working at heights and using combustible materials like torching on a wood deck pose significant safety risks. Proper safety measures, such as setting up guardrails and ensuring a safety zone around lifting equipment, are essential.

3. **Weather Conditions**: Starting the project in October means work will extend into winter, necessitating the use of winter-rated products and potentially impacting timelines due to weather constraints.

4. **Material Specifications**: Ensuring that fire-rated materials are used where required to meet safety standards and client expectations.

5. **Logistical Challenges**: The need for multiple mobilizations and demobilizations could lead to increased costs and scheduling complexities.

6. **Site Conditions**: Real site conditions may present unforeseen challenges that need to be addressed promptly.
