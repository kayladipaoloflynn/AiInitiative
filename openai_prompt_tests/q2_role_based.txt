Certainly, here are the underlying risks associated with performing work on this project, based on the transcript:

1. **Multiple Trades Coordination:**
   - KEL-WoodLake-BR(10)(VC): "there will be a situation with multiple trades in our way. We'll have to coordinate leverage and making sure we've got the safety zone set up around all lifting equipment."

2. **Safety Concerns:**
   - KEL-WoodLake-BR(10)(VC): "working on wood deck lot of torch, so safety to be watched out for."
   - "Picture framing current, all the penetrations, picture framing current, all parameters, all the combustibles will have to be removed from the working area the safety distance."

3. **Weather Conditions:**
   - KEL-WoodLake-BR(10)(VC): "we will be probably running into late, you know, late or in the winter and proceeding through the winter with that. So we'll definitely have some limitations with the With the cap stripping installation."

4. **Material Specifications:**
   - KEL-WoodLake-BR(10)(VC): "we'll have to use a winter rated product, so winter rated primers for the SOPRA VAP."

These risks should be addressed through careful planning, coordination with other trades, and adherence to safety protocols.
